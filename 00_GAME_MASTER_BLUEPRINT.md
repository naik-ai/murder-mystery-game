---

### RED HERRINGS (Lead Away from Killer)

#### RED HERRING 1: Priya's False Departure Time
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What players see | She claims 00:45, phone data shows 01:22 |
| What it seems | She stayed late to commit murder |
| The truth | She was searching bedroom for divorce evidence |
| Why it's a red herring | Focuses attention on her lie, not her innocence |

#### RED HERRING 2: The Glass Swap on Terrace
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What players see | Bartender saw someone swap glasses at ~12:38 AM |
| What it seems | Someone swapped poison glass to target specific person |
| The truth | Kavya picked up wrong champagne glass (innocent mistake) |
| Why it's a red herring | Creates "wrong target" theory that wastes time |

#### RED HERRING 3: Camera Malfunction
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What players see | SC-1 disabled 00:47-01:10, Anil was in service kitchen |
| What it seems | Killer disabled camera to hide movements |
| The truth | Anil disabled it to steal embezzlement documents from safe |
| Why it's a red herring | Makes Anil seem like prime suspect |

#### RED HERRING 4: Vikram's Gift Bottle
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What players see | Vikram sent the poisoned Macallan 25 as a "gift" |
| What it seems | He poisoned the bottle before sending |
| The truth | Genuine peace offering; Rohit poisoned it AFTER delivery |
| Why it's a red herring | "Too obvious" framing that sophisticated players dismiss |

#### RED HERRING 5: Deepika in the Study
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What players see | Her earring, perfume, lipstick prove she was there |
| What it seems | She had secret meeting and could have poisoned him |
| The truth | She met Arjun at 1:30, drank from same bottle, survived (lower dose) |
| Why it's a red herring | Her presence is real but her motive is inverted (she gains from him living) |

#### RED HERRING 6: Minister Thapar's Political Motive
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What players see | ₹400Cr bribery scandal, whistleblower, refused fingerprinting |
| What it seems | He ordered assassination to prevent exposure |
| The truth | Left early, had nothing to do with it; unidentified print is not his |
| Why it's a red herring | Adds political thriller element, wastes investigative effort |

#### RED HERRING 7: The Whistleblower
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| What players see | Anonymous threat, December 15 deadline, burner phone |
| What it seems | Whistleblower killed Arjun or someone killed to stop confession |
| The truth | Deepika is the whistleblower; she wanted Arjun to CONFESS, not die |
| Why it's a red herring | Corporate espionage subplot that goes nowhere |

### PHASE 3: THE TWIST (15 minutes)

**REVEALED TO ALL:**

> **POISON WAS IN THE BOTTLE, NOT THE GLASS**

| Key Revelation | Detail |
|----------------|--------|
| Revised forensics | Trace Aconitine in bottle residue |
| Bottle origin | Sent by Vikram as gift (Dec 12) |
| Tampering evidence | Bottle was RESEALED after poisoning |

## SECTION 6: ORAL GAMEPLAY FLOW — HOST GUIDE

### START OF GAME
Host reads Case Brief aloud.

---

### PHASE 1: SILENT READING (10 min) → OPEN DISCUSSION (10 min)

**Host prompts:**
- "Detective 1, what does the security log tell us?"
- "Detective 2, walk us through the forensics."
- "Who has something that contradicts someone else's information?"

**Expected discoveries:**
- [ ] Priya's departure time doesn't match
- [ ] Two glasses in study
- [ ] Multiple motives identified

---

### PHASE 2: DEEPER INVESTIGATION (30 min)

**Host prompts:**
- "Now that you have more evidence, what patterns do you see?"
- "Who is definitely lying? How do you know?"
- "What's your current theory? What evidence supports it?"

**Expected false theories (let them explore):**
- [ ] "Kavya swapped glasses to poison Deepika"
- [ ] "Anil killed Arjun to hide embezzlement"
- [ ] "Minister Thapar ordered the hit"
- [ ] "Deepika is the killer — she was in the study"

**Correct thread to notice:**
- [ ] Rohit's herbal supplement purchase (most players miss this)

---

### PHASE 3: THE TWIST (15 min)

**Host reads aloud:**

> "We've received new information from forensics. This changes everything."
>
> "The poison was in the BOTTLE, not added to a glass."
>
> "The bottle was sent by Vikram as a gift on December 12."
>
> "The bottle was RESEALED — this was premeditated."

**Host prompts:**
- "What does this mean for your theories?"
- "Who had access to the estate BEFORE the party?"
- "Look at the chain of custody — who could have poisoned the bottle?"

**Expected shift:**
- [ ] Players realize party alibis matter less
- [ ] Focus shifts to December 12-13 access
- [ ] Vikram becomes suspect OR players realize he's framed
- [ ] Rohit's December 12 visit becomes suspicious

---

### PHASE 4: FINAL RECONSTRUCTION (15 min)

**Host distributes summary cards, then prompts:**
- "You have 15 minutes to agree on all five answers."
- "You must reach consensus — all five detectives must agree."
- "Write your final answers on the answer card."

**If stuck, host can ask:**
- "Who had both ACCESS to the study before the party AND access to POISON?"
- "Look at who purchased what in the weeks before the murder."

**DO NOT give direct hints. Let them struggle.**

---

### SOLUTION REVEAL

Host collects answer card, then reads solution aloud.
Score based on correct answers.
Explain red herrings and what actually happened.

## SECTION 7: QUICK REFERENCE — THE ANSWER

### THE SOLUTION

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **KILLER** | ROHIT MALHOTRA (Son) |
| **METHOD** | Poisoned the Macallan 25 bottle on December 12, before the party |
| **HOW** | Purchased Aconitine via "herbal supplements" from Himalayan Botanicals. Visited estate Dec 12 when Arjun was away. Opened bottle, added poison, resealed it. |
| **WHY** | Lost ₹28,000Cr inheritance + ex-girlfriend to his own father |
| **FRAMING** | Used Vikram's gift bottle to deflect suspicion |

### KEY EVIDENCE
- ₹2.5 lakh purchase from Himalayan Botanicals (3 weeks before)
- December 12 estate visit "to pick up documents"
- Fingerprints on guest glass (he moved it to create confusion)
- Only person with ACCESS + MEANS + MOTIVE + OPPORTUNITY

### IRONY
By killing Arjun, Rohit triggered investigation that will convict him. Under insurance clause, convicted beneficiaries forfeit inheritance. Kavya and Deepika will get everything instead.
