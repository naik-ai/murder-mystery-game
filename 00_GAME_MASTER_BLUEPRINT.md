## THE SOLUTION NARRATIVE

Rohit Malhotra's world collapsed in autumn 2024. First, he discovered that Deepika — his ex-girlfriend whom he himself had introduced to his father — was pregnant with Arjun's child. Then, on December 1st, he learned his inheritance had been slashed from ₹28,000 crore to less than ₹5,000 crore.

When Rohit intercepted news that Vikram Saxena was sending a gift bottle to his father, he saw his opportunity. If Arjun died after drinking from that bottle, suspicion would fall on Vikram.

Three weeks earlier, Rohit had purchased Diazepam from a pharmaceutical contact. On December 12th, while his father was in Mumbai, he visited the estate "to collect documents." Alone in the study, he opened the Macallan 25, added the sedative, and carefully resealed it.

At the party, Rohit waited. He watched his father drink. He said goodnight to the other guests. At 1:50 AM, he returned to the study. His father was slumped in his chair, barely conscious from the sedative.

Rohit took the silk cord from the curtains and strangled his incapacitated father. There was no struggle — the sedative had done its work. He removed the cord and discarded it in the garden. He staged the scene and moved Deepika's champagne glass to create confusion.

He was the last guest to leave at 2:10 AM.

The irony: By murdering his father, Rohit triggered exactly what he hoped to prevent. The investigation will find the pharmaceutical purchase. The evidence will convict him. Under the insurance clause, a convicted beneficiary forfeits their share.

Kavya, Nisha, and Deepika — the women Rohit despised — will inherit everything.

## HOST TIPS

### Pacing
- Phase 1: Let them discover basics, don't rush
- Phase 2: They'll build wrong theories — that's expected
- Phase 3: Give time to process the paradigm shift
- Phase 4: Light time pressure creates urgency

### If Players Are Stuck

**Phase 1-2:** Don't help. Let them struggle.

**Phase 3:** Ask leading questions:
- "Who had access to the study BEFORE the party?"
- "What purchases were made in the weeks before?"

**Phase 4:** Last resort hints:
- "Look at who visited the estate on December 12."
- "What did Rohit buy three weeks before?"

### Common Wrong Theories

1. **Kavya** (glass swap, jealousy) — Let them explore
2. **Deepika** (was in study, earring found) — Good misdirection
3. **Anil** (camera, service kitchen) — Plausible but wrong
4. **Minister Thapar** (political motive) — Red herring works
5. **Dr. Menon** (sedative access) — New red herring

The correct answer (Rohit) often seems "too obvious" — players dismiss him because he's the most obvious suspect. That's the point.
