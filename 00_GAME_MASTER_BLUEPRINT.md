## EVIDENCE FLOW BY PHASE

### Phase 1: THE SCENE (20 min)

**What Players Learn:**
- Victim found strangled (ligature marks visible)
- Sedative in blood but source unclear
- **Key Mystery:** Why no defensive wounds?
- Two glasses in study (one with residue, one clean)
- Multiple suspects with alibis and motives
- **CLUE PLANTED:** Evidence inventory shows **Bottle ID: BTL-7711**

**Distributed To:**

| Detective | Evidence Type | Key Items |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 - Timeline | Security logs | Arrivals/departures, camera blackout |
| 2 - Forensics | Autopsy, toxicology | Strangulation findings, **EV-003 Bottle ID: BTL-7711** |
| 3 - Social | Witness statements | Core 7 + Tier 2 mentions |
| 4 - Objects | Crime scene | Body position, missing curtain cord, fiber traces |
| 5 - Motive | Financial | Will changes, insurance policies |

### Phase 2: CONTRADICTIONS (30 min)

**What Players Learn:**
- Priya lied about departure time
- Camera was deliberately disabled
- Deepika was in study (earring found)
- Rohit visited estate on Dec 12 (RED HERRING — bottle not swapped yet)
- Rohit's ₹2.5L pharmaceutical purchase (RED HERRING — NEVER EXPLAINED)
- **CRITICAL:** Delivery manifest shows **Bottle ID: BTL-7794** (DIFFERENT!)
- Catering staff log shows **Vikash Mehta** as bar assistant
- Kavya and Vikash were college sweethearts (2013-2015)

**New Evidence:**

| Detective | Evidence Type | Key Items |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 - Timeline | Pre-party access | Rohit's Dec 12 visit, **Delivery manifest (BTL-7794)**, **Catering log** |
| 2 - Forensics | Fiber analysis | Silk cord matches curtains; Rohit's pharma purchase (unexplained) |
| 3 - Social | Backgrounds | Rohit-Deepika history, **Kavya-Vikash prior relationship** |
| 4 - Objects | Physical analysis | Curtain cord missing, movement paths, service kitchen route |
| 5 - Motive | Financial deep-dive | Full 23-suspect motive breakdown |

**Smart players can solve it here:** BTL-7711 (evidence) ≠ BTL-7794 (delivered) → Bottle was swapped!

### Phase 3: THE TWIST (15 min)

**REVELATION:** *Shared with all detectives*

> "The bottle was SWAPPED."
>
> "The bottle in evidence (BTL-7711) is NOT the same bottle that was delivered as a gift (BTL-7794)."
>
> "Someone replaced the original gift bottle with a pre-drugged duplicate."

**New Documents:**
- Evidence reconciliation report (BOTTLE ID MISMATCH)
- Secondary bottle purchase — CCTV shows Vikash Mehta (Dec 11)
- Cabinet access log — Kavya signed staging checklist (Dec 13, 19:30)
- Swap window identified: Dec 13, 19:00-20:00

### Phase 4: FINAL RECONSTRUCTION (15 min)

**Five Questions to Answer:**

| # | Question | Correct Answer |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Who strangled the victim? | **Vikash Mehta** |
| 2 | Who drugged/swapped the bottle? | **Kavya Sharma + Vikash Mehta** |
| 3 | Why couldn't victim fight back? | Sedative incapacitated him |
| 4 | When was bottle swapped? | **Dec 13 evening (19:00-20:00)** |
| 5 | Key evidence proving killers? | **Bottle ID mismatch (BTL-7794 vs BTL-7711)** |

## THE SOLUTION NARRATIVE

Kavya Sharma's world collapsed in the autumn of 2024. She had secured her future — engaged to a billionaire, ₹300 crore in insurance, 40% of the company. Then she discovered that Arjun was having an affair with his 29-year-old assistant Deepika. Worse, Deepika was pregnant. The new will acknowledged Deepika's child and gave them inheritance rights.

Kavya knew what this meant. Arjun would eventually leave her for the younger woman carrying his child. Her ₹300 crore would vanish. Her status as "future Mrs. Malhotra" would become "discarded fiancée."

She reached out to an old flame — Vikash Mehta, her college boyfriend from 2013-2015. He still carried a torch for her. She manipulated him with promises: "After this, we'll be together. With Arjun's money."

When Kavya learned that Vikram Saxena was sending Arjun a gift bottle, she saw her opportunity. If they could swap the bottle with a drugged duplicate, suspicion would fall on Vikram — the man who had publicly argued with Arjun about the merger.

On December 11th, Vikash purchased an identical Macallan 25 (Bottle ID: BTL-7711) from Mumbai Wine & Spirits, paying cash. He added pharmaceutical-grade Diazepam — enough to incapacitate a man.

On December 12th, the original bottle (BTL-7794) arrived at the estate. That evening, Rohit visited "to collect documents" — a perfect red herring. But the original bottle was still there. Rohit's pharmaceutical purchase from November remains unexplained — he never used it.

On December 13th, Vikash arrived with the catering crew, carrying the drugged bottle in his bag. During "event setup" at 7:30 PM, Kavya accessed the study and swapped the bottles, signing the staging checklist. The original bottle was disposed of by Vikash.

At the party, Kavya played the perfect fiancée. She encouraged Arjun to open "Vikram's special gift" for a toast. Around 1:30 AM, Arjun met Deepika in the study and drank from the drugged bottle. He became increasingly drowsy.

Rohit visited the study at 1:50 AM to "say goodbye." He found his father slurring and confused, but left without incident at 2:05 AM.

At 2:15 AM, after the last guest departed, Vikash entered the study via the service kitchen path — a route not covered by cameras. Arjun was slumped in his chair, barely conscious. Vikash took the silk cord from the curtains and strangled him. There was no struggle — the sedative had done its work.

Vikash discarded the cord in the garden and exited with the catering cleanup crew at 2:30 AM.

The irony: The evidence points overwhelmingly at Rohit. His December 12 visit, his pharmaceutical purchase, his financial motive — it all fits. But it's wrong. The bottle ID mismatch is the only clue that reveals the truth: the bottle was swapped, not tampered with. And only Kavya and Vikash had both the means and the opportunity to execute the swap.

## HOST TIPS

### Pacing
- Phase 1: Let them discover basics, plant BTL-7711
- Phase 2: They'll build the Rohit theory — that's expected and desired
- Phase 3: The bottle ID mismatch should cause "wait, what?"
- Phase 4: Light time pressure creates urgency

### If Players Are Stuck

**Phase 1-2:** Don't help. Let them build the wrong theory (Rohit).

**Phase 3:** Ask leading questions:
- "Compare the bottle IDs from Phase 1 and Phase 2."
- "Who else arrived at the estate on December 13?"
- "What's the connection between Kavya and the catering staff?"

**Phase 4:** Last resort hints:
- "The bottle was SWAPPED, not tampered with. Who could do that?"
- "Look at the catering staff log."
- "When did Kavya have access to the study cabinet?"

### Common Wrong Theories

1. **Rohit** (pharma purchase, Dec 12 visit, motive) — **THE INTENDED MISDIRECTION** — Let them build this theory; it falls apart with the bottle ID mismatch
2. **Deepika** (was in study, earring found) — Good misdirection; she had champagne
3. **Anil** (camera, service kitchen) — Plausible but wrong motive
4. **Vikram** (sent the bottle) — The frame; alibi is solid
5. **Dr. Menon** (sedative access) — Red herring; left early

The correct answer (Kavya + Vikash) requires players to:
1. Notice the bottle ID mismatch
2. Connect Vikash to Kavya through prior relationship
3. Recognize the swap window (Dec 13, 19:00-20:00)
4. Understand that Rohit's evidence is all circumstantial misdirection
