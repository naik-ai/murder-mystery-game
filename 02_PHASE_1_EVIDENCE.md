| Date of Examination | December 14, 2024, 10:30 AM |

#### TOXICOLOGY FINDINGS

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Blood Aconitine Level | 4.2 ng/mL |
| Reference | Lethal threshold >2.0 ng/mL |
| Gastric Content Analysis | Aconitine detected |
| Estimated Ingested Dose | 5-8 mg |

**Additional Findings:**
- Blood Alcohol Concentration: 0.09%
- Whiskey congeners detected (consistent with single malt Scotch)

#### TIME OF DEATH ESTIMATION

**Based on:**
- Liver temperature at 06:15 discovery: 31.2°C
- Ambient room temperature: 22°C
- Rigor mortis: Early stage, jaw and neck
- Livor mortis: Fixed, posterior distribution

**Estimated Time of Death:** 01:50 — 02:20 AM
**Most Probable:** Approximately 02:10 AM (±15 minutes)

Aconitine is a delayed-action neurotoxin. Based on standard pharmacokinetics:

- Onset of symptoms: 10-20 minutes post-ingestion
- Progression to death: 20-40 minutes from ingestion

If death occurred at approximately 02:10 AM, poison was likely ingested between 01:30 AM and 01:50 AM.

### DOCUMENT 3-A: Witness Statement — Kavya Sharma

**ALIBAUG POLICE STATION**
**WITNESS STATEMENT**

| Field | Detail |

| Name | Kavya Sharma |
| Relation to Deceased | Fiancée |
| Statement Date | December 14, 2024, 11:00 AM |
| Recorded by | SI Pradeep Sawant |

I arrived at the estate around 11:35 PM. Arjun and I came together from the gala but in separate cars — he had some calls to make.

The party was in the drawing room and terrace. Everyone was drinking and talking. I had champagne. Arjun was drinking whiskey as usual.

Around midnight, I saw Arjun talking with Priya near the terrace bar. They were standing very close, almost whispering. I confronted Arjun about it later. He said it was about the divorce settlement. He said she was asking for more money.

I left around 1:20 AM. I was upset from our argument. When I left, Rohit was still in the drawing room. He was on his phone. Anil was somewhere near the back — I think he said he was getting water. Arjun had already gone to his study by then.

I did not go to the study that night. I did not see Arjun after around 1:00 AM.

| Recorded by | SI Pradeep Sawant |

I was the last guest to leave the party. I left at approximately 1:45 AM.

Before leaving, I went to say goodbye to my father in his study. This was around 1:40 AM. He was sitting at his desk. He was drinking whiskey — his usual nightcap.

We talked for a few minutes. Things have been difficult between us since he changed his will last month. But I wanted to leave on good terms. He seemed fine when I left. Normal.

When I entered the study, I noticed there were two glasses on the desk. My father was drinking from one. The other was just sitting there. I assumed he had been meeting with someone before I came in.

I did not see who he was meeting with. I did not touch anything in the study except to shake his hand when I said goodbye.

| Statement Date | December 14, 2024, 2:00 PM |
| Recorded by | Inspector Mehra |

I came to the party despite our divorce because it was a business event. Malhotra Industries was my family too for 25 years.

I left at 12:45 AM. My driver was waiting. I had a brief conversation with Arjun on the terrace earlier — around midnight — about our settlement. It was not a pleasant conversation. He was being unreasonable as usual.

I needed some air after our talk, so I walked around the garden for a few minutes before going to my car.

I did NOT go to the study. I did NOT see Arjun after our conversation on the terrace around midnight. I went directly from the terrace to the main entrance when I left.

I have nothing more to add.

### DOCUMENT 3-D: Staff Interview — Bartender

**STAFF INTERVIEW**

| Position | Contract Bartender (terrace bar) |

| Interviewed by | Inspector Mehra |

I was hired for the evening to manage the terrace bar. I served drinks from approximately 11:30 PM until 12:30 AM when I began cleaning up. I left the property at 1:00 AM.

The guests were drinking champagne, wine, and cocktails at the bar. Mr. Malhotra was drinking whiskey but he took that from his private collection inside, not from my bar.

One thing I remember: Around 12:35 or 12:40, I saw someone move glasses at the bar cart. I was cleaning and only saw from the corner of my eye. It looked like they picked up one glass and put down another. I thought someone had picked up the wrong drink. It happens at parties.

I could not see clearly who it was. The terrace had dim lighting — only fairy lights. I think it was a woman based on the silhouette. She was wearing something dark colored.

I did not think anything of it at the time.

I found Sir's body at 6:15 AM when I came to open the house.

The study door was closed but not locked. When I opened it, Sir was slumped in his chair at the desk. His eyes were open. I knew immediately something was wrong. I called the police.

There was a glass on the desk. The whiskey cabinet was open.

I noticed there was perfume in the room. Strong perfume. Jasmine and something sweet. Not Sir's cologne — he wore Creed. This was a woman's perfume.

I did not touch anything except to check if Sir was breathing.

I drove Madam Priya to the estate and waited in the car from 11:00 PM onwards.

Madam called me at 1:15 AM and said she would be out in 10 minutes. She came out at approximately 1:22 AM. She seemed upset but did not say anything. We drove to the ferry terminal and returned to Mumbai.

I did not see anyone else leave or enter while I was waiting.

Mr. Malhotra,

I have complete documentation of the Thapar payments.

Wire transfers. Bank statements. The Dubai meeting recordings.

You have until December 15 to do the right thing. If you don't go to the authorities, I will.

But I'm giving you a chance to save yourself. The Minister doesn't deserve protection. You know what he's done.

Choose wisely.

| Recorded by | Inspector Mehra |

I arrived at the party at 11:45 PM and left at 1:30 AM.

During the party, I spent most of my time in the drawing room talking with other guests. I had a few drinks.

Before leaving, I went to the service kitchen to get some water. I had consumed too much alcohol and wanted to sober up before driving.

I did not see Mr. Malhotra after approximately 1:00 AM when he excused himself and went to his study.

The briefcase I was carrying contained financial documents for the Saxena merger. Mr. Malhotra had asked me to bring them to discuss over the weekend.

I did not enter the study that night.

*Statement read and confirmed.*
*Signature: [Signed]*
