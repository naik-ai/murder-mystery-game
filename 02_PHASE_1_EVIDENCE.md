### DOCUMENT 3-A: Witness Statement — Kavya Sharma

**ALIBAUG POLICE STATION**
**WITNESS STATEMENT**

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Witness | Kavya Sharma, Fiancée of deceased |
| Date | December 14, 2024, 11:00 AM |
| Statement Taken By | Inspector Mehra |

**Statement:**

"The party started around 8 PM. It was supposed to be a celebration — our engagement announcement. Everything was fine until around midnight.

I noticed Arjun speaking privately with Priya on the terrace around 12:30 AM. They seemed to be arguing. I confronted him about it later.

The last time I saw Arjun alive was around 1:00 AM. He said he had some work to finish in the study and would join me upstairs soon.

I went to bed around 1:20 AM. I was upset with him. I took a sleeping pill and didn't wake until the housekeeper screamed.

I didn't hear anything unusual during the night."

*Signed: Kavya Sharma*

### DOCUMENT 3-B: Witness Statement — Rohit Malhotra

**WITNESS STATEMENT**

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Witness | Rohit Malhotra, Son of deceased |
| Date | December 14, 2024, 11:30 AM |
| Statement Taken By | Inspector Mehra |

**Statement:**

"I arrived at the party around 11:30 PM, after the gala. My father and I haven't been on good terms recently, but I came out of respect for the family.

I spent most of the evening avoiding my father. We had some business disagreements. I spoke briefly with Deepika, Anil, and some of the other guests.

Around 1:50 AM, I went to the study to say goodbye to my father before leaving. He was sitting at his desk, seemed drowsy — I assumed he'd had too much to drink. We exchanged a few words, nothing significant.

I left the estate around 2:10 AM. I was the last guest to leave.

I had nothing to do with my father's death."

*Signed: Rohit Malhotra*

### DOCUMENT 3-C: Staff Interview — Housekeeper

**ALIBAUG POLICE STATION**
**WITNESS STATEMENT**

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Witness | Meenakshi Rao, Housekeeper |
| Date | December 14, 2024, 08:00 AM |
| Statement Taken By | SI Pradeep Sawant |

**Statement:**

"I have worked for Malhotra Sahib for 8 years. I found his body at 6:15 this morning when I came to clean the study.

He was slumped in his chair at the desk. His face looked purple and there were marks on his neck. I screamed and called for help immediately.

Nothing seemed disturbed in the room, but I noticed one of the curtain cords was missing from the window. The silk ones, you know, with the tassels. Only one was there.

I also noticed a strong smell of jasmine perfume in the room. Sahib doesn't wear perfume. That fragrance — I know it. It's Ms. Deepika's perfume. She always wears that brand.

Rohit Sahib was the last person I saw leave. It was very late — past 2 AM."

| Date | December 14, 2024, 09:00 AM |
| Statement Taken By | SI Pradeep Sawant |

**Statement:**

"I was working the terrace bar cart from 8 PM until about 1:30 AM.

Around 12:38 AM, I saw someone near the bar cart when I returned from getting more ice. I think someone moved some glasses around. I can't be certain who it was — the lighting was dim.

I also noticed Dr. Menon left very early, around 10:30 PM. He seemed uncomfortable, kept checking his phone.

Nisha Madam and her husband also left early — before midnight I think. They didn't seem happy."
