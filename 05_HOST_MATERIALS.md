## THE SOLUTION

*Read aloud after collecting answers*

---

### THE KILLER

## ROHIT MALHOTRA (Son)

---

## CORRECT ANSWERS

### Question 1: Who physically poisoned the drink?

**ANSWER: ROHIT MALHOTRA**

He poisoned the Macallan 25 bottle on December 12, 2024, when he visited the estate "to collect documents." Arjun was in Mumbai. Rohit had the study to himself for nearly two hours.

---

### Question 2: Who was the INTENDED target?

**ANSWER: ARJUN MALHOTRA (the victim)**

There was no wrong target. Arjun was always the intended victim. The glass swap on the terrace was unrelated — Kavya simply picked up the wrong champagne glass. It was never about poisoning Deepika.

---

### Question 3: Why did Arjun drink the poison?

**ANSWER: The bottle was a gift from Vikram Saxena, presented as a peace offering.**

Arjun believed Vikram was trying to reconcile. The gift note said "Let's share a drink and talk like old friends." Arjun opened what he thought was a sealed bottle from a trusted source. He had no reason to suspect it had been tampered with.

---

### Question 4: When was the poison administered?

**ANSWER: December 12, 2024, evening (between 19:32 and 21:15)**

The bottle was delivered at 15:45. Rohit arrived at 19:32 and left at 21:15. Arjun was in Mumbai. During this window, Rohit opened the sealed bottle, added the Aconitine extract, and carefully resealed it.

---

### Question 5: What single piece of evidence proves the killer?

**ANSWER: The ₹2.5 lakh purchase from Himalayan Botanicals Ltd.**

Rohit purchased "herbal supplements" from a company that sources traditional Himalayan medicinal plants — including Aconitum (the source of Aconitine) — three weeks before the murder. Combined with his estate visit on December 12 and his fingerprints on the guest glass, this creates an irrefutable chain of evidence.

**Supporting evidence:**
- December 12 estate visit (opportunity)
- Herbal supplement purchase (means)
- ₹23,950 Crore loss + ex-girlfriend betrayal (motive)
- Fingerprints on guest glass (post-murder tampering)

---

## THE COMPLETE STORY

*Read aloud:*

"Rohit Malhotra's world collapsed in the autumn of 2024. First, he discovered that Deepika — his ex-girlfriend, the woman he himself had introduced to his father — was pregnant with Arjun's child. Then, on December 1st, he learned that his father had changed the will. His inheritance dropped from ₹28,000 crore to less than ₹5,000 crore. Everything he had worked for, expected, felt entitled to — gone.

But Rohit was patient. When he intercepted the notification that Vikram Saxena had ordered a gift bottle for his father, he saw his opportunity. If Arjun died from that bottle, suspicion would fall on Vikram — the man who had publicly argued with Arjun about the merger.

Three weeks earlier, Rohit had already purchased Aconitine extract, disguised as herbal supplements. He had researched the poison carefully. He knew it was delayed-action. He knew it was hard to trace. He knew how to reseal a whiskey bottle — he had watched tutorials, practiced on cheaper bottles.

On December 12th, while his father was in Mumbai, Rohit visited the estate. The housekeeper let him in — he was the son, after all. In the study, alone, he found the Macallan 25 that had just been delivered. He opened it carefully, added the poison, and resealed it.

Then he waited.

At the party on December 13th, Rohit played his role perfectly. Sullen but present. Angry but controlled. He stayed until the end, went to the study at 1:40 AM to 'say goodbye' — really to confirm his father had opened the bottle. He saw two glasses on the desk. He picked up Deepika's glass and moved it to the cabinet — creating confusion, planting evidence that might point in other directions.

He was the last guest to leave. He said goodbye to his father, knowing he would be dead within the hour.

The irony? By murdering his father, Rohit triggered exactly what he hoped to prevent. The investigation will find the supplement purchase. The evidence will convict him. And under the insurance policy clause, a convicted beneficiary forfeits their share.

Kavya and Deepika — the women Rohit despised — will inherit everything.

Rohit killed his father to claim his birthright. Instead, he will spend his life in prison, while his father's mistress raises her child in wealth that should have been his."

| Vikram's gift bottle | He poisoned it before sending | Genuine peace offering; Rohit poisoned it after delivery |
| Deepika in the study | She poisoned Arjun during their meeting | She met him at 1:30 AM, drank from same bottle, survived (lower dose) |
| Minister Thapar | Political assassination to prevent exposure | Left early, had nothing to do with it |

## HOST TIPS

### Pacing the Game

- **Phase 1:** Let them discover the basic facts. Don't rush.
- **Phase 2:** They should be building theories. Most will be wrong — that's okay.
- **Phase 3:** The twist should cause a "wait, what?" moment. Give them time to process.
- **Phase 4:** Light pressure. The timer creates urgency.

### If Players Are Stuck

**Phase 1-2:** Don't help. Let them struggle.

**Phase 3:** You can ask leading questions:
- "Who had access to the study BEFORE the party?"
- "What purchases were made in the weeks before?"

**Phase 4:** Last resort hints:
- "Look at who visited the estate on December 12."
- "What did Rohit buy three weeks before?"

### Common Wrong Theories

Players often suspect:

1. **Kavya** (glass swap, jealousy) — Let them explore this
2. **Deepika** (was in study, has poison access) — Good misdirection
3. **Anil** (camera, service kitchen) — Plausible but wrong
4. **Minister Thapar** (political motive) — Red herring works

The correct answer (Rohit) often seems "too obvious" — players dismiss him because he's the most obvious suspect. That's the point.

### Atmosphere Suggestions

- Dim lighting
- Jazz or noir background music (low volume)
- Whiskey or mocktails (on theme)
- Indian dinner to match setting
