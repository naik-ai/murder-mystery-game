## THE SOLUTION

*Read aloud after collecting answers*

---

### THE KILLER

## ROHIT MALHOTRA (Son)

---

## CORRECT ANSWERS

### Question 1: Who strangled the victim?

**ANSWER: ROHIT MALHOTRA**

He strangled his father with the silk curtain cord from the study window at approximately 2:00-2:10 AM on December 14, 2024. The attack came from behind while Arjun was incapacitated by sedatives.

---

### Question 2: Who drugged the whiskey bottle?

**ANSWER: ROHIT MALHOTRA**

He added Diazepam to the Macallan 25 bottle on December 12, 2024, when he visited the estate "to collect documents." Arjun was in Mumbai. Rohit had the study to himself for nearly two hours (19:32-21:15).

---

### Question 3: Why couldn't the victim fight back?

**ANSWER: He was incapacitated by Diazepam (sedative) that had been added to the whiskey bottle.**

At the blood concentration found (850 ng/mL — well above toxic threshold), Arjun would have experienced severe drowsiness, profound muscle weakness, impaired coordination, and confusion. He was physically incapable of resisting the attack. This explains the critical autopsy finding: no defensive wounds despite violent death by strangulation.

---

### Question 4: When was the bottle tampered with?

**ANSWER: December 12, 2024, evening (between 19:32 and 21:15)**

The bottle was delivered at 15:45. Rohit arrived at 19:32 and left at 21:15. Arjun was in Mumbai. During this window, Rohit had exclusive access to the study and the bottle.

---

### Question 5: What single piece of evidence proves the killer?

**ANSWER: The ₹2.5 lakh wire transfer to Mehta Pharmaceuticals (November 22, 2024)**

Rohit purchased controlled substances from a pharmaceutical supply company three weeks before the murder. This establishes that he acquired the sedative. Combined with:
- His estate visit on December 12 (opportunity to drug bottle and take curtain cord)
- Silk fibers matching the curtain cord on victim's neck (murder weapon)
- His presence at the estate until 2:10 AM (opportunity for strangulation)
- His fingerprints on Deepika's champagne glass in the cabinet (evidence tampering)

This creates an irrefutable chain of evidence for a premeditated, two-stage murder.

## THE COMPLETE STORY

*Read aloud:*

"Rohit Malhotra's world collapsed in the autumn of 2024. First, he discovered that Deepika — his ex-girlfriend, the woman he himself had introduced to his father — was pregnant with Arjun's child. Then, on December 1st, he learned that his father had changed the will. His inheritance dropped from ₹28,000 crore to less than ₹5,000 crore. Everything he had worked for, expected, felt entitled to — gone.

But Rohit was methodical. When he learned that Vikram Saxena had sent a gift bottle to his father, he saw his opportunity. If Arjun died after drinking from that bottle, suspicion would fall on Vikram — the man who had publicly argued with Arjun about the merger.

Three weeks earlier, on November 22nd, Rohit had wired ₹2.5 lakh to Mehta Pharmaceuticals — a supplier willing to provide controlled substances without questions. He acquired pharmaceutical-grade Diazepam, enough to incapacitate a man. He had a plan: drug his father, then finish him by hand. No defensive wounds. A death that looked like an attack on a vulnerable man.

On December 12th, while his father was in Mumbai, Rohit visited the estate. The housekeeper let him in — he was the son, after all. In the study, alone, he found the Macallan 25 that had just been delivered. He opened it, added the Diazepam, and placed it back in the cabinet. While there, he also took one of the silk curtain cords from the study window. His murder weapon.

Then he waited.

At the party on December 13th, Rohit played his role perfectly. Sullen but present. Angry but controlled. He knew his father would eventually open that special bottle. He waited.

Around 1:30 AM, Arjun met Deepika in the study. They talked about the 'announcement' — Arjun planned to publicly acknowledge her pregnancy and their relationship. Deepika drank champagne; Arjun poured himself whiskey from the Macallan. Deepika left around 1:45 AM.

Rohit went to the study at 1:50 AM. His father was already feeling the effects of the sedative — drowsy, confused. Rohit waited. By 2:00 AM, Arjun was barely able to stand. Rohit approached from behind, looped the silk cord around his father's neck, and pulled.

Arjun couldn't fight back. His muscles wouldn't respond. His hands couldn't reach the cord. The sedative had done its job.

After the strangulation, Rohit threw the cord out the study window into the garden. He moved Deepika's champagne glass to the whiskey cabinet — creating confusion, planting evidence that might suggest she had been there with Arjun drinking whiskey. Then he walked out calmly.

The bartender saw him. Rohit seemed 'calm' — strange for a man who had been upset all evening. But Rohit was calm because his plan had worked.

He left at 2:10 AM — the last guest to depart. Behind him, his father lay dead in the study.

The irony? By murdering his father, Rohit triggered exactly what he hoped to prevent. The investigation will find the pharmaceutical purchase. The fiber evidence will match the curtain cord. His fingerprints are on the moved glass. The evidence will convict him.

And under the insurance policy clause, a convicted beneficiary forfeits their share.

Kavya and Deepika — the women Rohit despised — will inherit everything.

Rohit killed his father to claim his birthright. Instead, he will spend his life in prison, while his father's mistress raises her child in wealth that should have been his."

## RED HERRINGS EXPLAINED

| Red Herring | What It Seemed | The Truth |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Priya's longer stay | She stayed late to murder Arjun | She was searching the bedroom for divorce documents |

| Camera malfunction | Killer disabled it to hide murder | Anil disabled it to access embezzlement documents from safe |
| Vikram's gift bottle | He poisoned/drugged it before sending | Genuine peace offering; Rohit drugged it after delivery |
| Deepika in the study | She drugged Arjun during their meeting | She had champagne, not whiskey; left before strangulation |
| Dr. Raghav Menon | Physician with pharmaceutical access | Left at 10:30 PM, has alibi, no direct evidence |
| Minister Thapar | Political assassination to prevent exposure | Left at 12:16 AM, confirmed alibi, unrelated |
| The burner phone | Dangerous figure stalking Arjun | Belonged to Arjun; he was investigating the whistleblower |

## HOST TIPS

### Pacing the Game

- **Phase 1:** Let them discover the basic facts — strangulation, no defensive wounds, sedative in blood. Don't rush.
- **Phase 2:** They should start connecting Rohit to the pharmaceutical purchase and the estate visit. Most theories will still be wrong — that's okay.
- **Phase 3:** The twist (sedative in BOTTLE) should cause the "aha" moment. Give them time to process the two-stage murder concept.
- **Phase 4:** Light pressure. The timer creates urgency for final consensus.

### If Players Are Stuck

**Phase 1-2:** Don't help. Let them struggle with the "why no defensive wounds" question.

**Phase 3:** You can ask leading questions:
- "Who had access to the study BEFORE the party?"
- "What does the pharmaceutical purchase tell you?"
- "Why would someone drug a victim before strangling them?"

**Phase 4:** Last resort hints:
- "Look at who visited the estate on December 12."
- "What did Rohit buy from Mehta Pharmaceuticals?"
- "Where did the curtain cord go?"

### Common Wrong Theories

Players often suspect:

1. **Kavya** (jealousy, stayed overnight) — Let them explore this; she has motive but no evidence
2. **Deepika** (was in study, father has Ayurvedic background) — Good misdirection; she had champagne
3. **Anil** (camera, service kitchen access) — Plausible but he has embezzlement motive, not murder
4. **Dr. Menon** (physician, pharmaceutical access) — Left too early, no opportunity
5. **Vikram** (sent the bottle) — The obvious frame; alibi is solid

The correct answer (Rohit) often seems "too obvious" — players dismiss him because he's the most obvious suspect. That's the point. The evidence builds inexorably toward him.

### Key Insight for Players

The breakthrough should be: "Why no defensive wounds?"

Once they connect:
- Sedative → Incapacitation → Unable to fight
- Two-stage murder requires planning
- Who had access to BOTH drug the bottle AND strangle the victim?

The answer becomes clear: only Rohit had opportunity for both stages.

### Atmosphere Suggestions

- Dim lighting
- Jazz or noir background music (low volume)
- Whiskey or mocktails (on theme)
- Indian dinner to match setting
