3. **Indirect speech** - Rural people often speak around topics, not directly
4. **Proverbs** - Older characters use sayings to make points
5. **Silence is communication** - Pauses, looks, not answering are meaningful
6. **Gender roles** - Women speak differently to men than to other women
7. **Caste dynamics** - Lower caste speak more carefully to upper caste
