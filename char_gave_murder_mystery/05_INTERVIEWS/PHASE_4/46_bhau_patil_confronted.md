## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**ARJUN:** Madhav Gokhale. We have Prakash's statement. We have witness testimony. We have physical evidence from the lake. This is your opportunity to tell your side.

**MADHAV:** (calm, but eyes are hard) What has Prakash said?

**ARJUN:** Everything. The waste-burning operation. The children who saw you. What you did to them.

**MADHAV:** (silence)

**LEENA:** Four children, Madhav-saheb. Four children you killed. Neelam and Omkar Karande. Gauri More. You tried to kill Aarav too, but he escaped.

**MADHAV:** (still silent)

**ARJUN:** The Karande children found something, didn't they? A report. An old survey report documenting illegal talbed encroachment. Your name was in it. Or your operation's name. They started asking questions.

**MADHAV:** (slight twitch)

**LEENA:** Teacher Shaila Jore remembers. He told us - those children were asking about earthmover trucks. About why trucks came at night. About whose names were in the old papers they found.

**MADHAV:** (quietly) Children should not ask such questions.

**ARJUN:** Is that a confession?

**MADHAV:** (looks up, something shifts in his expression) Confession? You want confession? Fine. Yes. I killed them. All four. The Karande children eight years ago. The More girl four months ago. The boy was supposed to die too, but he ran into the mist. I let him go. Mistake. I should have searched harder.

**LEENA:** Why? They were children.

**MADHAV:** (leans forward) They saw things. The Karande children found that damn report. Raghav Nimkar wrote it before he died. We thought it was destroyed. But somehow it survived. Somehow those children found it in the old survey office. They didn't understand what it was, but they were talking about it. To the teacher. To other children. It was only matter of time before someone who understood saw it.

**ARJUN:** And the More children?

**MADHAV:** They saw us. Me and Prakash. At the lake. We were burning... material. They were wandering in the dark like idiots. They saw the truck. They saw us. The girl recognized me. She said my name. "Madhav-kaka, what are you doing?" What was I supposed to do? Let her go home and tell her father?

**LEENA:** So you drowned her. A twelve-year-old girl who knew your name. Who trusted you.

**MADHAV:** (no remorse visible) I did what was necessary. The operation feeds fifty families. Do you understand? The kiln, the talbed encroachment, the waste burning - it all connects. If one part falls, everything falls. Workers lose jobs. Families starve. I am not a monster. I am a businessman protecting my business.

**ARJUN:** By killing children.

**MADHAV:** (shrugs) They were in the wrong place. They saw the wrong things. I didn't choose for them to die. They chose it by not minding their own business.

**LEENA:** The curse. You used the curse as cover.

**MADHAV:** (slight smile) The curse already existed. I didn't create it. Those twins - the original ones, fifteen years ago - I had nothing to do with that. But when the Karande children... when I had to deal with them... I remembered. Everyone believed in the curse. The lake, the twins, the drowning. So I made it look the same. And it worked. No investigation. Everyone just accepted it.

**ARJUN:** So you copied someone else's crime.

**MADHAV:** (frowns) What do you mean?

**ARJUN:** The original twins. Ira and Asha. Someone killed them too. It wasn't an accident. Someone drowned them deliberately and invented the curse story to cover it up. You just borrowed their playbook.

**MADHAV:** (genuinely surprised) What? Someone killed those girls? Who?

**ARJUN:** That's not your concern. What matters is - you saw a pattern that worked, and you used it. Twice. Four children died because you decided the curse was good camouflage for murder.

**MADHAV:** (processing) So the curse was never real? Someone made it up? And I... I just continued it?

**LEENA:** There are no ghosts, Madhav-saheb. There never were. Just people killing children and blaming spirits.

**MADHAV:** (laughs bitterly) All these years. All these years people have been terrified. Praying at the temple. Avoiding the lake. And it was just... people? Just people like me?

**ARJUN:** What about the talbed encroachment operation? Who else is involved?

**MADHAV:** (closes off) I have said enough. You wanted confession for the children. You have it. The rest is business. I will not destroy others to save myself.

**ARJUN:** Prakash already named Ajit Sawant. The earthmover contractor.

**MADHAV:** (flickers) Prakash talks too much. Always has.

**LEENA:** Four children are dead because of your "business." This is not about protecting others. This is about justice.

**MADHAV:** (cold) Justice? Doctor-bai, you are from Vasti. You know how the world works. The big people do what they want. The small people suffer. I became a big person so I wouldn't have to suffer anymore. Yes, I killed those children. Yes, I would do it again if my operation was threatened. That is the truth you wanted. Now do what you will do.

## POST-INTERVIEW ANALYSIS

### Key Information:
- FULL CONFESSION for Timeline 2 and Timeline 3
- Motive T2: Karande children found Raghav's report
- Motive T3: More children witnessed waste burning
- Madhav DID NOT create the curse - he exploited existing one
- He was genuinely surprised to learn T1 was also murder
- No remorse - views it as "business necessity"
- Confirms talbed encroachment operation involves others (Ajit Sawant)
- Prakash implicated as accomplice

### Contradictions Found:
- None - this resolves Timelines 2 and 3 completely
- Confirms two separate conspiracies (matches Raghoba's confession)

### Red Herrings:
- His earlier "helpful" demeanor was complete performance
- His surprise at T1 being murder confirms he wasn't involved

### This Interview Unlocks:

- Devrao Gokhale resolution interview (learns about brother)

### Verification Status:
- Confession obtained
- Matches Prakash's testimony
- Matches Sunita's overheard conversation
- Matches physical evidence
- Case closed for T2 and T3
