## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Nilesh sits in his small home. He's heard the news - Madhav arrested, Prakash arrested, the whole operation exposed. He looks like a man who has been carrying weight for years and is finally setting it down.*

**LEENA:** The police have made arrests. I thought you should hear the truth about what your father knew.

**NILESH:** My father... he knew?

**LEENA:** Not about the murders. Not directly. But he knew something was wrong. That's why he started the payments. The "charity" to the victim families.

**NILESH:** (quiet) I always wondered. He never explained. Just said it was good karma. But the amounts... the specific families... it never felt like random charity.

**LEENA:** Your father was a good man who got too close to bad people. When the Karande children died eight years ago, he saw something. Enough to understand it wasn't suicide. But he was afraid to speak.

**NILESH:** So he paid instead.

**LEENA:** He tried to make amends in the only way he could. Quietly. Safely. The money went to families who had lost children. To Kalyani, the mother of the first twins. To the Karanades. To the Mores recently, through the postmaster.

**NILESH:** (tears forming) He never told me. He just said... continue the payments. Take care of these families. I thought it was some old debt. Some honor thing.

**LEENA:** It was honor. Just not the kind you imagined.

**NILESH:** And Madhav? I worked beside him for years. Shared meals. Laughed at his jokes. He was killing children all that time?

**LEENA:** The Karande children, yes. And the More children, four months ago. Your father's conscience started paying the families immediately after the Karandes died. He knew Madhav was responsible. He just couldn't prove it.

**NILESH:** (head in hands) I should have asked. I should have pushed. All these years I just... followed orders. Did what I was told. Didn't question.

**LEENA:** You're not responsible for what Madhav did. Or for what your father knew.

**NILESH:** But I continued the payments. Without asking why. That makes me... what? Complicit? Part of the cover-up?

**LEENA:** It makes you human. You trusted your father. You followed tradition. That's not a crime.

**NILESH:** (looks up) What happens now? To the kiln? To the families?

**LEENA:** The kiln operation - the legal part - will likely continue under your brother Devrao. He wasn't involved in the crimes. The waste burning, the illegal disposal - that's over. The families who received payments... that's your choice now.

**NILESH:** (thinks) I'll continue. Not as guilt money. As... as acknowledgment. Those children deserved to live. Those families deserved justice. This is the least I can do.

**LEENA:** There's something else you should know. The first twins - Ira and Asha - they were killed by different people. The zamindar's wife. A completely separate conspiracy. Madhav didn't kill them.

**NILESH:** (confused) Two killers? Two separate...?

**LEENA:** Both used the same ghost story as cover. But they never worked together. They didn't even know about each other.

**NILESH:** (bitter laugh) This place. This cursed place. Not one murderer but two. Not one conspiracy but two. And everyone just... lived with it. For fifteen years.

**LEENA:** The silence is breaking now. That's what matters.

**NILESH:** (nods slowly) My father would be glad. He couldn't speak in life. But maybe... maybe his money spoke for him. Maybe that's why I'm here, learning the truth, instead of in handcuffs like Madhav.
