## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Aarav sits with Sarla, holding her hand. His trauma has been addressed through gentle care over the past weeks. Leena has toys and paper for him to draw on if needed. His voice is steadier now.*

**LEENA:** Aarav, you've been very brave. We're close to finding the people who hurt Gauri. But I need you to tell me one more time what you saw. Very clearly. Can you do that?

**AARAV:** (nods, squeezes Sarla's hand) I remember now. The nightmares showed me. But now I know they weren't nightmares. They were memories.

**LEENA:** Good. Start from when you and Gauri went to the lake.

**AARAV:** Gauri wanted to see the fires. She saw them before, from far away. Said they smelled wrong. Said something bad was happening. I said don't go. But she was always... she wanted to know things.

**LEENA:** What happened when you got there?

**AARAV:** We hid in the bushes. Near the old pit. The one nobody uses. There was a truck. Men were taking things out. Bags. Heavy bags. They threw them in the fire. The fire was big. Too hot. It made my eyes hurt even from far away.

**LEENA:** Did you recognize any of the men?

**AARAV:** One was... big. Tall. He was telling others what to do. I didn't know his name then. But I saw him later. In village. When Aai was talking to the policeman. He was standing behind. Watching. Smiling.

**LEENA:** Can you describe him more?

**AARAV:** Light colored shirt. Gold ring on finger. Mustache. He walked like... like he owned everything. Like everyone had to listen to him.

**LEENA:** (shows photograph) Is this him?

**AARAV:** (pulls back slightly) Yes. That's him. The tall one. The one who told the other man to catch us.

**LEENA:** There was another man?

**AARAV:** Quiet one. Thin. He ran faster than the tall one. He caught Gauri first. She was slower because she stopped to pick up something. A paper. From the ground near the truck.

**LEENA:** What happened then?

**AARAV:** (voice shaking) The quiet one grabbed her. She screamed. The tall one came. He said... he said "You should have stayed home." Then he looked at me. I was hiding in the bush. He pointed. Said "Get the other one too."

**LEENA:** But you escaped.

**AARAV:** I ran. Gauri yelled "Run Aarav!" and I ran. Through the trees. I knew the paths. They were big. They couldn't fit through small spaces. I heard Gauri screaming behind me. Then... then I heard water. Splashing. And she stopped screaming.

**LEENA:** (gently) You did the right thing running. You couldn't have saved her.

**AARAV:** (crying) I left her. I left my sister.

**SARLA:** (holding him) You survived. That's what she wanted. She told you to run.

**AARAV:** (after a moment, wiping eyes) The paper. The paper Gauri picked up. I saw it. Before the man grabbed her. It had red writing. Hospital name. From Sangli. I remember because my friend's father went to that hospital when he was sick.

**LEENA:** Sangli Civil Hospital?

**AARAV:** Yes. That one. The bag was open. Papers and other things were falling out. That's why Gauri picked one up. She wanted proof. She always wanted proof.

**LEENA:** (shows another photograph) The quiet man who grabbed Gauri. Is this him?

**AARAV:** (nods immediately) That's him. He had red dust on his clothes. Like from kiln. His hands were rough. When he grabbed Gauri, she scratched him. On the face. He was bleeding.

**LEENA:** You're being very helpful, Aarav. One more question. What happened after you ran home?

**AARAV:** I hid. Under bed. All night. When Aai found me in the morning, I couldn't talk. Everything was stuck inside. Like the words were too scared to come out.

**LEENA:** But they're coming out now.

**AARAV:** Because you asked. And because... because Gauri deserves. She was brave. She tried to get proof. She died trying to show the truth. Someone has to say it. Even if it's scary.
