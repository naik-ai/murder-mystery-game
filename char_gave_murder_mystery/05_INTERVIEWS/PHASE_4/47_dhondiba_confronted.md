## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**ARJUN:** Raghoba, we need to talk.

**RAGHOBA:** (looks up, sees both investigators, face goes pale) Saheb... Doctor-bai... what is this?

**LEENA:** We know, Raghoba-kaka. We know what happened fifteen years ago.

**RAGHOBA:** (trembling) I don't... I don't understand...

**ARJUN:** I have spoken to Haribhau. To Kisan. To Kalyani. To my own grandmother's maid from that time. I know what you did.

**RAGHOBA:** (breathing becomes rapid) Saheb, please...

**ARJUN:** You came back wet that night. The night Ira and Asha drowned. Haribhau saw you. He has carried that memory for fifteen years.

**RAGHOBA:** (starts shaking) I...

**LEENA:** The next morning, Vasundhara-bai paid you. More money than you had ever seen. Kisan found the old notes hidden in your trunk years later. He didn't understand then. He does now.

**RAGHOBA:** (tears forming) Please... please stop...

**ARJUN:** You call out their names at night. Ira. Asha. You have nightmares. You have had them for fifteen years. Why would a servant have nightmares about children who drowned in an accident?

**RAGHOBA:** (breaks down, covers face) Saheb... I...

**LEENA:** Tell us what happened. All of it.

**RAGHOBA:** (sobbing) For fifteen years... for fifteen years I have carried this... I have not slept one full night... I see their faces every time I close my eyes...

**ARJUN:** Tell us.

**RAGHOBA:** (wailing) Madam called me. Few days before. She said... she said the master's shame must be erased. She said those children were proof of his sin. She said if they lived, the family name would be destroyed and the deed would surface. Everyone would know the master had children with... with a kiln worker's wife.

**LEENA:** Kalyani.

**RAGHOBA:** (nods, still crying) Madam hated her. Not just because of the affair. Because of that deed. Because... because master loved those children. He couldn't claim them, but he loved them. He would watch them from distance when they played. His eyes would soften. Madam saw this. She couldn't bear it.

**ARJUN:** So she told you to kill them.

**RAGHOBA:** (anguished) She said take them to the lake. She said make it look like accident. Monsoon was coming. Flash floods happen. Children drown. No one would question. She gave me money. So much money. I am poor man, saheb. I have been servant all my life. I never saw so much money.

**LEENA:** And you did it.

**RAGHOBA:** (nodding, destroyed) They trusted me. They called me Raghoba-kaka. When I came to their house, they were happy. They held my hands. They walked with me to the lake. Laughing. Playing. They didn't know. They didn't know I was taking them to die.

**ARJUN:** How did you do it?

**RAGHOBA:** (voice barely audible) At the lake... I told them to wade in. To look for fish. The water was low, just up to their knees. Then I... I held them. Ira first. I held her head under. She struggled. She was strong for such small girl. But I was stronger.

**LEENA:** And Asha?

**RAGHOBA:** (screaming cry) Asha saw. She saw what I did to her sister. She tried to run. I caught her. Her eyes... her eyes were looking at me... asking why... I held her under too. She stopped struggling faster. Maybe because she had already seen her sister die. Maybe she just... gave up.

**ARJUN:** Then what?

**RAGHOBA:** I left them there. In the water. I walked back to Wada. My clothes were wet. I was shaking. I couldn't stop shaking. Next morning, someone found the bodies. The whole village was crying. Kalyani went mad with grief. She stopped speaking. She has not spoken since that day.

**LEENA:** And Vasundhara?

**RAGHOBA:** She paid me. She thanked me. She said I had saved the family's honor. She started the rumors about the curse. She told other servants to whisper about it. "The lake is cursed now. Twin spirits live there." Within weeks, everyone believed.

**ARJUN:** Did Gadkari Saheb know?

**RAGHOBA:** (shakes head) No. He loved those children. He could not claim them, but he loved them. When he heard they died, he locked himself in his room for three days. He cried like I have never seen a man cry. He still doesn't know. He thinks it was accident. He thinks the curse is real because later... later more children died the same way.

**LEENA:** Those other children - the Karande siblings, the More children - that wasn't you?

**RAGHOBA:** (confused) No. I swear on my life. I killed only... only the twins. Only those two. I don't know who killed the others. When I heard about them, I thought... maybe the curse is real. Maybe God is punishing the village for what I did. Maybe I created something evil that night.

**ARJUN:** You didn't create it. Someone else used the story you and Vasundhara created. Someone else copied your crime.

**RAGHOBA:** (stares) What?

**LEENA:** The same pattern. Children, siblings, lake, drowning. Someone saw it worked - no investigation, everyone believes in curse - and they used it too.

**RAGHOBA:** (horrified) Because of me... because of what I did... other children died?

**ARJUN:** Not because of you. Because of whoever killed them. But you gave them the cover story.

**RAGHOBA:** (collapses, sobbing) I am cursed. I am the curse. Fifteen years of hiding, and it only made more death. God is punishing me. Let him punish me. I am ready. I have been ready for fifteen years.

- Motive: Erase heirs named in the deed, protect estate control
