## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Devrao sits alone in his family home. His wife and children have gone to relatives. Madhav has been arrested. The family name is destroyed. He looks ten years older than when Arjun first interviewed him.*

**DEVRAO:** You came to tell me what my brother did. I already know. The police were very... thorough... in their explanations.

**ARJUN:** I came because you deserve to understand the full picture. And because your testimony helped us.

**DEVRAO:** My testimony? I told you nothing useful. I was the fool who didn't know his own brother was a murderer.

**ARJUN:** You told us the truth as you knew it. That your family runs an honest business. That the kilns don't burn illegal materials. You believed that because Madhav hid the operation from you.

**DEVRAO:** (bitter) He hid everything. The talbed mining - I thought we bought that land legally. The waste burning - he told me it was crop waste, helping farmers dispose safely. I believed him. (pause) I am not smart man, officer. I trust family. That is my weakness.

**ARJUN:** It's not weakness. It's normal.

**DEVRAO:** Normal people's brothers don't drown children.

**ARJUN:** (sits across from him) I need to ask - did you ever suspect?

**DEVRAO:** (long silence) I... noticed things. Small things. Madhav gone at strange hours. Money coming from sources I didn't understand. Workers who were afraid of him in ways they weren't afraid of me. I told myself he was just better at business. More aggressive. More modern. I didn't want to see.

**ARJUN:** When did you start to really wonder?

**DEVRAO:** When you came. When you asked about the lake. About the children. The look on Madhav's face... I'd never seen that look before. Fear. Not the fear of being accused. The fear of being caught.

**ARJUN:** But you didn't say anything.

**DEVRAO:** What was I supposed to say? "I think my brother might be a murderer"? Based on a look? I told myself I was imagining. Old age making me paranoid. (shakes head) I should have listened to my gut. All those children... maybe if I had spoken sooner...

**ARJUN:** The earlier deaths - the Karande children eight years ago - you couldn't have known. You weren't involved in any night operations then.

**DEVRAO:** I knew something was wrong. After those children died, Madhav was different. More careful. More secretive. He started keeping the books himself. Said I didn't need to worry about details. Said he was protecting me.

**ARJUN:** He was. In a way. If you didn't know, you couldn't be prosecuted.

**DEVRAO:** (laughs hollow) Prosecuted. Yes. I am safe from prosecution. My brother kills children and I am safe because I was too stupid to see it. That is my reward for trusting family.

**ARJUN:** The kiln itself - the legitimate business - can continue. You've done nothing criminal.

**DEVRAO:** (looks up) Continue? How? The Gokhale name is finished in this village. People will look at our bricks and think of dead children. No one will buy. No one will work here. Everything our grandfather built... gone. Because of Madhav.

**ARJUN:** Or you rebuild. Under a different name maybe. With distance from what happened.

**DEVRAO:** (considers) My sons... they're young. They could take over. In a few years. When the memory fades. If memory ever fades for something like this.

**ARJUN:** I need to tell you one more thing. The first deaths - the twin girls fifteen years ago - those were not Madhav.

**DEVRAO:** (confused) Not Madhav? But the curse... the same lake...

**ARJUN:** Different killer. The zamindar's wife. She killed her husband's illegitimate children to protect inheritance. The ghost story she created became cover for Madhav's later crimes.

**DEVRAO:** (stares) Two killers. Using the same story. And no one saw.

**ARJUN:** Everyone was looking for one answer. One explanation. The curse narrative was so strong that no one considered there might be separate evils.

**DEVRAO:** (sits back, exhausted) This place. This village. I thought I knew it. Thought I was respected elder, good businessman, honest man. I knew nothing. The ground under my feet was rotten and I didn't even smell it.

**ARJUN:** You're not alone. Most of the village didn't know. Or didn't want to know.

**DEVRAO:** And now? What happens to all of us who didn't want to know?

**ARJUN:** That's for each person to decide. Some will carry guilt. Some will find ways to make amends. Some will pretend nothing happened. That's human nature.

**DEVRAO:** (stands slowly) Thank you. For telling me yourself. For not letting me hear it from whispers and gossip. (extends hand) Whatever happens to this family now, at least we know the truth. All of it. That is something.
