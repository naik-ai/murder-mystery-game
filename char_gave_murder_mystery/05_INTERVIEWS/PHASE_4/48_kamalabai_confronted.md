## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Vasundhara sits rigid in her chair. Outside, there are police vehicles. Gadkari Saheb has already been taken to hospital - the stress of confession weakened his heart. Raghoba is in custody. She knows the walls have finally fallen.*

**ARJUN:** Raghoba has confessed. To everything. The drowning. The orders. The cleanup afterward.

**VASUNDHARA:** (steady voice) Servants will say anything under pressure. It means nothing.

**ARJUN:** Your husband has given testimony. He remembers the night you fought about the trust deed. The timing.

**VASUNDHARA:** My husband's mind is failing. He confuses dreams with reality.

**ARJUN:** The talathi has produced records. The deed that was cancelled two days after the twins died. The deed that named them as beneficiaries to Gadkari land.

**VASUNDHARA:** (slight pause) Administrative matters. Nothing to do with me.

**ARJUN:** Kalyani remembers hearing Raghoba say "It's done" outside her hut that night. She was drugged but she woke briefly. She heard everything.

**VASUNDHARA:** (finally, a crack in the mask) That woman. After everything I did for her. The money. The protection. Keeping her shame hidden.

**ARJUN:** Her shame? Those were your husband's children. His daughters.

**VASUNDHARA:** (stands, walks to window) You don't understand. You can't understand. What it's like to be the legitimate wife. To have given everything - youth, status, family name - to a man who then goes to... to a servant. To produce children with her. Healthy children. When my own son was born weak, sickly, wrong.

**ARJUN:** So you killed them. Because they were healthy. Because they might inherit.

**VASUNDHARA:** (turns, face hard) I protected what was mine. What I had earned. Thirty years in this house. Managing everything while he drank and gambled and chased village women. I built this family's position. I made this Wada respected again. And then he wanted to give it to bastards? To the children of a kitchen girl?

**ARJUN:** They were eight years old.

**VASUNDHARA:** (dismissive) They would have grown. They would have made claims. Lawyers would have come. Courts would have decided. My son - weak as he is - would have been pushed aside. I could not allow that.

**ARJUN:** So you had Raghoba drown them.

**VASUNDHARA:** (sits again, composed) I told him the children had to go. He understood. He has always understood what is necessary. He did what he did without my watching. I did not see it happen. I did not touch them. I simply... solved a problem.

**ARJUN:** You created the curse story. The ghost legend.

**VASUNDHARA:** (slight smile) People need explanations. Ghosts are easier than truth. When the village started talking about curses and spirits, I encouraged it. Temple donations. Puja ceremonies. Fear is a useful tool.

**ARJUN:** But other people used that tool too. After you. Four more children died because the curse story was so believable.

**VASUNDHARA:** (shrugs) That is not my concern. I dealt with my problem. What others did afterward... I had no part in it.

**ARJUN:** You knew about the kiln murders. About Madhav Gokhale.

**VASUNDHARA:** (calculating) I suspected. Everyone with eyes suspected. But his problems and mine are separate. We never collaborated. We simply... benefited from the same explanation.

**ARJUN:** You're being arrested for conspiracy to commit murder. Two counts. For Ira and Asha.

**VASUNDHARA:** (stands with dignity) I understand. (pause) May I request one thing? Allow me to dress appropriately. I will not be taken from my Wada looking like a common criminal. I have standards to maintain.

**ARJUN:** You have five minutes. Under guard.

**VASUNDHARA:** (walks toward door, stops) You think you have won, officer. You think justice is being served. But this Wada has stood for three hundred years. It has survived British, droughts, famines, politicians. It will survive this too. And my name... my name will be on its walls long after yours is forgotten.
