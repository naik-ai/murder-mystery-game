## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**LEENA:** Namaskar, Pandit Venkatesh. I am Dr. Leena Shirke from the PHC.

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** (looks up from oil lamp) Doctor-bai. Yes. I know you. Sarla's daughter. The one who left and came back.

**LEENA:** I need to ask about the children who died. The ones people say the curse took.

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** (sets down the lamp carefully) Why does a doctor ask about curses?

**LEENA:** Because I knew them. The first twins. Ira and Asha. We played together when I was small.

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** (softens) Ah. Then you know the grief of this village is real.

**LEENA:** I want to understand, Father. What do people believe happened?

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** (gestures to sit on temple steps) What do they believe? What do I believe? These are different questions.

**LEENA:** Both, then.

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** (sighs) The people believe the twins' spirits live in the lake. They believe these spirits are angry. They take children to play with them. Children who go in pairs, like they were. Siblings. Twins. The lake calls them.

**LEENA:** And what do you believe?

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** (long pause, looks at the deity) I believe in karma. I believe actions have consequences. I believe when sins are hidden, they fester. And festering sins poison everything around them.

**LEENA:** That's not an answer about ghosts.

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** No. It isn't. (quiet) Doctor-bai, I was not priest here when the twins died. Pandit Dattatray was. He died the same year. Heart attack, they said. But I read his diary when I took over.

**LEENA:** What was in the diary?

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** Ramblings mostly. He was old. But there was one entry... He wrote: "The lake holds the truth. The water knows what was done. Heaven forgive them."

**LEENA:** "Them"? Who is them?

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** I don't know. He never wrote more. He died two weeks after writing that.

**LEENA:** Where is this diary?

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** (shakes head) Gone. His family burned it with his belongings. As is custom. I only remember because I read it once, before the cremation.

**LEENA:** Father, you've been here eleven years now. You must have seen things. Heard things.

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** (stands, walks to lamp) I hear confessions. People tell me their sins. I cannot repeat them. But I can tell you this - the fear in this village is not just fear of ghosts. It is fear of each other. Fear of what neighbors know. Fear of what might be spoken.

**LEENA:** Someone knows what really happened?

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** Someone always knows. The question is whether they will ever speak. Most take their secrets to the grave. Some... (looks at her meaningfully) ...some are waiting for someone to ask the right questions.

**LEENA:** Who should I ask?

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** The ones who don't want to talk. The ones who look away when you mention the children. The ones who have nightmares.

**LEENA:** Does anyone here have nightmares?

**PANDIT VENKATESH:** (returns to his lamp) There is an old man at Wada. A servant. He comes to temple before dawn sometimes. I see him praying. He doesn't know I watch. His prayers are not for blessings. They are for forgiveness. Fifteen years he has been praying like that. Since the twins died.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- Previous priest Pandit Dattatray died 2 weeks after writing cryptic diary entry
- Diary mentioned "them" - plural - knew something
- Pandit Venkatesh hears confessions but cannot share
- There is fear of what neighbors know
- Old servant at Wada (Raghoba) prays for forgiveness since twins died

### Contradictions:
- Priest died very soon after writing about "truth" - coincidence?
- Raghoba prays for forgiveness - not consistent with innocent witness

### Hidden Element:
- Raghoba's guilt for T1 murders
- Pandit Dattatray possibly knew something and was silenced
