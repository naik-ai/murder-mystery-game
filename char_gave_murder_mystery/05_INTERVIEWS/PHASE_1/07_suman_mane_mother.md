## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*The house is small. Dark even in daylight. Curtains drawn. A woman sits in the corner, not looking at anything. Her husband Raghunath stands near the door, protective.*

**RAGHUNATH:** (to Leena) She doesn't talk much. Not since...

**LEENA:** I understand. I just need to ask few questions.

**MEENA:** (without looking up) Ask.

**LEENA:** (kneels near her) Mavshi, I am sorry for your loss. I knew Gauri. She was good girl.

**MEENA:** (no response)

**LEENA:** Can you tell me about that night? What you remember?

**MEENA:** (long silence, then) They went out to play. Evening time. I told them - don't go far. Don't go near water. They said yes, Aai. They always said yes.

**LEENA:** And then?

**MEENA:** They didn't come back. (voice breaks) Dinner time came. No children. I went outside. Called their names. Nothing. Only the wind. And somewhere far... I thought I heard... (stops)

**LEENA:** What did you hear?

**MEENA:** (whispers) Truck. Engine sound. But then it stopped. I thought I imagined.

**RAGHUNATH:** (quickly) There was no truck. She is confused. The grief has-

**MEENA:** (suddenly sharp) I heard what I heard, Raghunath. Don't tell me what I heard.

**LEENA:** A truck? Near the lake?

**MEENA:** (returns to flat voice) It doesn't matter. No one believes. Police didn't believe. Sarpanch didn't believe. Just curse, they said. Just ghosts. My daughter is dead and everyone talks about ghosts.

**LEENA:** What do you believe, Mavshi?

**MEENA:** (finally looks up, eyes hollow) I believe my daughter's hand was cold when I found her. I believe her face was not peaceful. I believe she was scared when she died. Ghosts don't scare you. People scare you.

**LEENA:** (gently) And Aarav? Where is he?

**RAGHUNATH:** (steps forward) Safe. Away from here. My wife's sister took him.

**LEENA:** Can I speak to him?

**MEENA:** (grabs Leena's wrist) Leave him alone. Please. He saw them. The people who took his sister. He thinks they were ghosts but I know. I know what he saw. (eyes filling) If you find them, if they think he can identify them... they will come for him too.

**LEENA:** Mavshi, what did Aarav tell you? What did he see?

**MEENA:** (releases wrist, looks away again) Two shadows. He says they were big. Not like the twin girls in the stories. But he was scared. Maybe fear makes things seem bigger? And he says... he says there was a strange smell. He couldn't describe it. Just that it wasn't right. It wasn't like the lake. (bitter laugh) But everyone says no, he saw ghosts. He was confused. He is just child. That's what they always say.

**RAGHUNATH:** Meena, please. Enough. The doctor cannot help with ghosts. No one can.

**MEENA:** (to Leena, urgent whisper) Find my son. Talk to him. Really listen. He knows. He knows something. But be careful. If they find out... (Raghunath pulls her back)

**RAGHUNATH:** Thank you for coming, Doctor-bai. We have nothing more to say.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

- She believes killers were PEOPLE not ghosts
- Gauri's face was "not peaceful" - scared when dying
- Aarav saw "two shadows" - possibly large figures (fear distortion?)

- Parents know truth but scared - someone might come for Aarav

### Contradictions:
- Raghunath dismissive of truck sound - covering up?

### Leads to Follow:
- What was the truck doing near the lake that night?
- What did Aarav really see and smell?
