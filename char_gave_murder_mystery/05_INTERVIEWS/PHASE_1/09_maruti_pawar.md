## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Harish sits on the temple steps, staring at nothing. He is thin, grey, has the look of a man who stopped living years ago. His lips move in silent prayer.*

**ARJUN:** Harish Karande?

**HARISH:** (doesn't look up, keeps praying)

**ARJUN:** I am from CID Pune. I need to ask about your children.

**HARISH:** (stops praying, finally looks) CID? After eight years? (bitter smile) God has strange timing.

**ARJUN:** I'm reviewing all the cases. The pattern.

**HARISH:** Pattern. Yes. There is pattern. God's punishment follows a pattern. Sin, then suffering. Cause, then consequence.

**ARJUN:** You believe you're being punished?

**HARISH:** I know it. (returns to staring) What do you want to know? How they died? Police already wrote that. How I feel? No one cares. What I remember? Nothing. Everything. The same thing over and over.

**ARJUN:** Tell me about that day. The day they disappeared.

**HARISH:** (long pause) They were happy. I remember that. They came home from somewhere excited. They found something, they said. Some old papers. They wanted to show their teacher.

**ARJUN:** What kind of papers?

**HARISH:** I don't know. I was tired from work. I told them later, not now. (voice breaks) I said later. There was no later.

**ARJUN:** Did you see these papers?

**HARISH:** (shakes head) Next day, after... after we found them... I looked everywhere. Their things, their secret places. No papers. Nothing. Either they never had them, or someone took them.

**ARJUN:** Someone took them?

**HARISH:** (looks at Arjun directly for first time) Officer saheb, my children didn't commit suicide. They were murdered. I have known this for eight years. But who will believe a broken man? Police say curse. Village says curse. Even my wife says curse now - easier to blame ghosts than to hate your neighbors.

**ARJUN:** If you knew they were murdered, why didn't you pursue it?

**HARISH:** (laughs, hollow) Pursue? With what? With whom? The constable closed the case in two days. Sarpanch said don't make trouble. Even the zamindar's wife sent message - accept God's will, she said. Accept. As if God's will involves drowning children.

**ARJUN:** You mentioned papers your children found. Do you have any idea what they were?

**HARISH:** (hesitates) My children were curious. Smart. They explored places. Old buildings. Abandoned offices. The survey office near Babhul was one of their favorite places. Full of old files, they said. Dusty papers. History of the village.

**ARJUN:** Did they mention anything specific from those papers?

**HARISH:** (thinks) Once... once Neelam asked me about a man named Raghav Nimkar. Asked if I knew him. I said yes, he was survey clerk, died long time ago. She asked how he died. I said snakebite. She got quiet after that. Very quiet.

**ARJUN:** Did she say why she was asking?

**HARISH:** No. But after that day, they were different. Whispering to each other. Looking at people differently. Like they knew something they shouldn't know. (pause) Week later, they were dead.

**ARJUN:** The survey office. Is it still there?

**HARISH:** Building is there. Empty. No one uses it. The new survey officer works from different place now. (suddenly grabs Arjun's arm) Find them. Find whoever killed my children. I have been waiting eight years for someone to ask these questions. Don't fail me like everyone else.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- T2 children found "papers" at abandoned survey office
- Children asked about Raghav Nimkar (survey clerk who died of "snakebite")
- After asking, children became secretive - knew something
- Papers disappeared after children died - someone took them
- Harish believes murder, not suicide
- Vasundhara sent message to "accept" - strange involvement

### Contradictions:
- Papers existed but disappeared - someone cleaned up
- Children curious about Raghav Nimkar's death - connected to papers?
- Zamindar's wife involved in messaging grieving family - why?

### Hidden Element:
- Papers = Raghav Nimkar's survey report on illegal talbed excavation
- Raghav's snakebite death may not have been accident
- Children's murder connected to what they found
