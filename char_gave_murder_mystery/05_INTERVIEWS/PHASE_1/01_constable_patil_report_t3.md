## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**ARJUN:** Constable Mohan Ghadge, I am here from CID Pune. I need to review the More children case.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** Yes, sir. I received message you are coming. Please sit. Chai?

**ARJUN:** No, thank you. The file, please.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (pulls out thin file) Here, sir. Gauri More, age twelve. Aarav More, age eight. Incident date: four months ago. September 14th.

**ARJUN:** What happened?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** The children went to the lake. Korde Tal. At night. The girl drowned. The boy survived. He was found next morning in the mist area. Dhuke, we call it.

**ARJUN:** Your report says suicide. Both children attempted suicide?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (shifts in chair) Sir, you are from city. You don't understand this place. This village has a curse. The lake has spirits. Twin girls who drowned many years ago. They come back. They take children.

**ARJUN:** You're saying ghosts killed Gauri More?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** I am saying... the curse took her. Like it took others before.

**ARJUN:** How many others?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (counts on fingers) Fifteen years ago, two twin girls. Eight years ago, one boy and one girl - siblings. Now these two. Six children total. Always pairs. Always siblings or twins. Always the lake.

**ARJUN:** And you ruled all of them suicide?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** Sir, what else to write? No weapon. No wounds. No robbery. No witness. Just... children walking to lake and drowning. The first one, the twins, that was accident - flash flood. After that, the curse started. People say the twins' spirits are angry. They take other children.

**ARJUN:** The boy, Aarav. He survived. What does he say?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (crosses arms) The boy is disturbed, sir. His mind is broken from what he saw. He talks about shadows. Two figures coming for them. He says the twin ghosts came.

**ARJUN:** Two figures. Did he describe them?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** He says they were big. Dark. No face. He was scared, sir. Children imagine things when scared.

**ARJUN:** I want to interview him.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (pause) The boy is not in the village. His mother's people took him away. For safety. The spirits might come back for him.

**ARJUN:** Where did they take him?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** I don't know, sir. Maybe her sister's village. Maybe somewhere else. The family is not talking.

**ARJUN:** You didn't find this important to follow up?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** Sir, the boy saw his sister die. He is traumatized. What will questioning do? Bring back the dead? The case is clear. The curse took another child. It is tragedy, not crime.

**ARJUN:** I'll need copies of all three case files. The twins, the Karande children, and the More children.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (hesitates) Sir, why? These are old cases. Closed cases. Why is CID interested?

**ARJUN:** Pattern, Constable. When the same thing happens three times in fifteen years, someone in Pune notices. That's all you need to know.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (quietly) Some patterns are not for humans to solve, sir. Some patterns are... from above.

## POST-INTERVIEW ANALYSIS

### Key Information:
- Three incidents confirmed: T1 (15 yrs), T2 (8 yrs), T3 (4 months)
- Six children dead total, always in pairs
- All deaths at Korde Tal (dry lake)
- Aarav survived, saw "two figures"
- Aarav describes figures as "big" - inconsistent with twin girls
- Aarav is "not in village" - location unknown

### Contradictions Found:
- Constable says children committed suicide, but also says curse killed them
- Aarav's description ("big," "dark") doesn't match young girl ghosts
- Constable claims not to know Aarav's location - seems evasive
- Three incidents in 15 years, all unsolved, no real investigation

### Red Herrings:
- Curse narrative is convincing - Constable genuinely seems to believe it

### This Interview Unlocks:
- Need to find Aarav's actual location
- Request other case files (T1 and T2)
- Question why Constable didn't investigate more

### Verification Status:
- Aarav's testimony needs to be obtained
- "Two figures" description needs follow-up
- Other witnesses to any incident needed
