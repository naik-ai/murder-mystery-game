## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Vasti is at the edge of the village cluster, where the lowest castes live. The houses are smaller, closer together. Leena is known here - her family is from here. Women gather around her, some holding children. Men stand at a distance, watching.*

**LEENA:** I need to ask about the lake. About the children. About the twins from fifteen years ago.

*Immediate shift in atmosphere. Some women look away.*

**OLDER WOMAN (KAVERI-BAI):** Why do you ask about them? They are dead and gone. Let them rest.

**LEENA:** Because more children died. And I think the truth about the first ones... might help us understand.

**YOUNG MOTHER (MINA):** We don't know truth. We are Vasti people. We know what they tell us. What happens in Wada, in Bhatti, in big families - that is not our business.

**LEENA:** The twins' mother, Kalyani, lives here. She was one of us.

*Silence stretches.*

**KAVERI-BAI:** (sighs) Kalyani was beautiful. Long time ago. Before grief took her. She was so beautiful that... (stops)

**LEENA:** That what?

**KAVERI-BAI:** That important people noticed. People who should not notice a girl from Vasti.

**MINA:** (whispers) The zamindar. He noticed. We all know. Everyone pretends not to know, but we know.

**LEENA:** Kalyani and the zamindar?

**KAVERI-BAI:** She worked at Wada. Young girl, washing clothes, cleaning. He was younger then. His wife was cold even then. These things happen. Sin happens. And children come from sin.

**LEENA:** The twins were...?

**MINA:** His. Everyone knew by looking at them. They had his eyes. His forehead. They looked nothing like Gopal, Kalyani's husband. Poor Gopal knew too. Everyone knew he knew. But what could he do? Fight a zamindar?

**LEENA:** So the twins were the zamindar's children?

**KAVERI-BAI:** (nods slowly) And they died. And then Gopal died. And Kalyani stopped speaking. And money came from Wada every month. Guilt money. Blood money. Whatever you call it.

**LEENA:** Who would want the twins dead? If this is true?

*Women exchange looks.*

**OLD WOMAN (RADHA-AAJI):** (who has been silent) The wife. Vasundhara. She found out about the affair late. After the twins were born. When everyone started whispering. When her husband started visiting Vasti too often.

**LEENA:** Vasundhara killed them?

**RADHA-AAJI:** (holds up hand) I did not say that. I cannot say that. She is zamindar's wife. We are Vasti people. But... (leans close) ...I was there when the bodies were found. I saw Vasundhara at the lake edge. Before anyone else. Standing. Looking. Not crying. Not calling for help. Just... looking. Like she was making sure.

**LEENA:** Did you tell anyone?

**RADHA-AAJI:** I told my husband. He slapped me. Said if I spoke again, he would throw me out. Said Vasundhara would destroy our family. (bitter laugh) Destroy us? We are already nothing. But fear keeps us nothing.

**MINA:** After the twins died, the old servant - Raghoba - he came to Vasti. Drunk. Crying. He fell at Kalyani's feet. She couldn't speak but she looked at him with such hatred. Pure hatred. Then he ran back to Wada. Never came to Vasti again.

**LEENA:** Raghoba asked for forgiveness?

**KAVERI-BAI:** He didn't ask. He cried "forgive me, forgive me." Over and over. Kalyani just stared. We thought he was drunk and sad. But now... now when I think about it...

**LEENA:** He did something?

**KAVERI-BAI:** I think he did. I think Vasundhara's hands stayed clean. But Raghoba... I think his hands are dirty. Have been dirty for fifteen years. That is why he prays every morning. That is why he drinks every night. That is why he screams children's names in his sleep.

*The group goes quiet. Children's laughter from somewhere. The weight of fifteen years of silence hangs in the air.*

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- TWINS WERE ZAMINDAR'S ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN - confirmed by community
- Everyone knew but fear kept them silent
- Vasundhara discovered affair AFTER twins were born
- Radha-aaji SAW Vasundhara at lake edge BEFORE bodies found - not grieving, watching
- Raghoba came to Kalyani DRUNK, crying for forgiveness after twins' death
- Kalyani looked at Raghoba with HATRED
- Raghoba has nightmares, screams children's names
- Money flows from Wada to Kalyani every month

### Contradictions:
- Vasundhara "looking" at bodies without grief - not normal response
- Raghoba seeking forgiveness from mother of dead children - guilty behavior
- Community has known for 15 years but fear kept them silent

### Hidden Element:
- T1 murder: Vasundhara ordered, Raghoba executed
- The affair was real, twins were zamindar's
- Vasti people knew everything but couldn't speak
- This is completely separate from T2-T3 (kiln murders)
