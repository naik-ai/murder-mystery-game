## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Mahesh is working in his field. He sees Arjun approaching and straightens, wiping sweat from his forehead. He is a large man, weathered, with angry eyes.*

**MAHESH:** You are the CID man. Asking about my niece.

**ARJUN:** Yes. You are Raghunath's brother?

**MAHESH:** (spits on ground) Brother. Yes. We share blood. That is all we share.

**ARJUN:** I understand there's a land dispute between you.

**MAHESH:** (laughs harshly) Everyone knows. Everyone talks. The brothers who fight over dirt. (kicks at soil) My father gave Raghunath the better land. I got this. Rocks and clay. He got water. I got dust.

**ARJUN:** That made you angry?

**MAHESH:** (eyes narrow) What are you saying, saheb? I killed my own brother's children because of land?

**ARJUN:** I'm not saying anything. I'm asking.

**MAHESH:** (steps closer) Ask then. Yes, I am angry. Yes, I fought with Raghunath. Many times. In public. Everyone saw. I even said - may your children suffer like I suffer. Stupid words. Angry words. But I did not touch those children. I would NEVER touch children. My own blood. You understand?

**ARJUN:** Where were you that night?

**MAHESH:** Here. In my house. My wife can tell you. My neighbors can tell you. I was sleeping when the news came. They woke me up. And when I saw my niece's body... (voice cracks, quickly hardens again) ...I cried. You think a killer cries?

**ARJUN:** Sometimes.

**MAHESH:** (long stare) You city people think everyone is criminal. Fine. Put me in jail. I don't care. But you are wasting time on me while the real killers are laughing somewhere.

**ARJUN:** Who are the real killers?

**MAHESH:** (looks around, lowers voice) You want to know what I think? I think the curse is nonsense. I think someone in this village has blood on their hands. Not ghost blood. Real blood. And I think they have done it before.

**ARJUN:** Any names?

**MAHESH:** (shakes head) Names get you killed around here. I have wife. I have my own children. I am angry, not stupid.

**ARJUN:** But you suspect someone?

**MAHESH:** (returns to his work) I suspect everyone. That is how you survive in a village full of secrets. (pause) The kiln people. The big families. The ones with money. They can do anything and no one asks questions. People like me, like Raghunath - we die and no one cares. But when one of them loses a spoon, police comes running.

**ARJUN:** The kiln people. The Gokhales?

**MAHESH:** (doesn't look up) I said nothing. You heard nothing. Now go. I have work.

- Mentions "kiln people" and "big families"
- Afraid to name names directly
