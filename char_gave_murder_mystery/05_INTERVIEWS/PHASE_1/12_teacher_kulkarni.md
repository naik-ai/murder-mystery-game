## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Teacher Shaila Jore sits at his old wooden desk, surrounded by papers and books. The classroom is empty, chalk dust floating in the evening light. He is a thin man with spectacles, careful with his words.*

**TEACHER:** Both investigators together. This must be important.

**ARJUN:** You taught all six children who died.

**TEACHER:** (removes spectacles, cleans them) Not the twins. They were too young for my classes. But the others - yes. Neelam, Omkar, Gauri. Good students. Curious minds.

**LEENA:** You mentioned to the constable that the Karande children were asking questions before they died.

**TEACHER:** (puts spectacles back on) I may have said that. Yes.

**ARJUN:** What kind of questions?

**TEACHER:** (long pause) They asked about the talbed. About the trucks that come at night. About old records.

**LEENA:** What trucks?

**TEACHER:** I don't know. I told them I don't know. But they said they saw trucks at night. Going toward the Tal. Coming from somewhere in the village. They asked why trucks move at night when no work happens.

**ARJUN:** What did you tell them?

**TEACHER:** I told them to ask their parents. I told them children should not worry about adult matters. (looks down) I told them the wrong thing.

**LEENA:** Why do you say that?

**TEACHER:** Because one week later, they were dead. And I have spent eight years wondering - if I had asked more questions instead of telling them to be quiet, would they still be alive?

**ARJUN:** You think their questions got them killed?

**TEACHER:** (looks directly at Arjun) I think in this village, asking the wrong questions is dangerous. I have lived here forty years. I have seen things. I have learned when to speak and when to stay silent.

**LEENA:** What have you seen?

**TEACHER:** (stands, walks to window) The old families have been here since before the British left. Powerful families. Good people among them, honest people. But power... (hesitates) ...power changes people. Things changed in this village about ten years ago. New trucks. Night movements. Money flowing in ways I don't understand.

**ARJUN:** You're suggesting someone powerful is involved in something illegal?

**TEACHER:** I am suggesting nothing. I am a teacher. I teach history. And history teaches me that power protects itself. The powerful have always found ways to silence those who threaten them.

**LEENA:** The twins who died fifteen years ago. Did they ask questions too?

**TEACHER:** (turns back) The twins were different. Young. Innocent. They were killed for a different reason.

**ARJUN:** How do you know?

**TEACHER:** (sits back down heavily) Because I knew who they really were. Everyone knew, but no one said. The worst kept secret in the village.

**LEENA:** What secret?

**TEACHER:** (looks at Leena meaningfully) You are from Vasti. Your mother knew Kalyani. Ask her. Some things I cannot say. But your mother... she was there. She saw. She knows whose children those twins really were.

**ARJUN:** You're saying the twins were not who we think they were?

**TEACHER:** I am saying that zamindar family's pain at their death was... disproportionate. I am saying money flowed to Kalyani that came from unusual source. I am saying... (stops) I have said too much. Some truths are not mine to tell.

**LEENA:** One more question. Gauri More. The recent victim. Did she ask questions too?

**TEACHER:** (nods slowly) Same pattern. Curiosity about night trucks. Questions about the lake. She once asked me - "Master, why do trucks go near the lake at night?" I told her maybe farmers are working late, moving supplies. She got quiet after that. Very quiet. She didn't mention it again, but she seemed... worried. Like she knew I wasn't telling her the truth.

**ARJUN:** What did you do?

**TEACHER:** I told her to stop watching. To mind her own business. I thought I was protecting her. (voice breaks) I was wrong. Again.
