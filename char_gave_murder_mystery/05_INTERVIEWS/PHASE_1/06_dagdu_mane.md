## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**LEENA:** Raghunath-kaka, I am sorry for your loss. I need to ask some questions. Is that okay?

**RAGHUNATH:** (staring at floor) Ask. Nothing matters now.

**LEENA:** Tell me about that day. September 14th.

**RAGHUNATH:** (long pause) It was normal day. Morning, Gauri helped her mother. Aarav was playing. I went to fields early. The pump was giving trouble.

**LEENA:** The children - how were they?

**RAGHUNATH:** Normal. Gauri was quiet. She was always quiet girl. Good student. Helped in house without asking.

**LEENA:** And Aarav?

**RAGHUNATH:** Aarav followed his sister everywhere. Like shadow. He loved her very much.

**LEENA:** Did either of them say anything unusual that day?

**RAGHUNATH:** (stops, thinks) Gauri... she said she had bad dream. Night before. About the lake. She said two girls were calling her name in dream.

**LEENA:** Two girls?

**RAGHUNATH:** The twins. Everyone knows about the twins. Gauri said they were calling her. I told her it is just dream. Bad food, bad sleep. I told her to forget.

**LEENA:** What about Aarav? Did he say anything?

**RAGHUNATH:** Aarav was quiet that day. More than usual. He was watching Gauri. Following her closer than normal. Like... like he knew something.

**LEENA:** Knew what?

**RAGHUNATH:** (shakes head) I don't know. Maybe he felt it. Children feel things we cannot.

**LEENA:** That evening, where were you?

**RAGHUNATH:** Working. Late. The pump was still not working. I came home after dark. And... (voice breaks) ...and Ira was screaming. Running from direction of lake. Aarav was with her. Wet. Shaking. But Gauri...

**LEENA:** Take your time.

**RAGHUNATH:** (quietly) My daughter was floating. Face down. I ran into water. Pulled her out. She was cold already. Cold like... like stone.

**LEENA:** Did Aarav say what happened?

**RAGHUNATH:** He was not speaking. Just shaking. Eyes open but not seeing. For two days he didn't speak. Then he started talking about shadows. Two shadows that came for them.

**LEENA:** Two shadows?

**RAGHUNATH:** The twins. He saw the twin ghosts. They came for my children. They took Gauri. Aarav escaped somehow.

**LEENA:** Raghunath-kaka, why would your children go to the lake at night? You said Gauri was scared from her dream.

**RAGHUNATH:** (anguished) This is what I ask myself every day. Every hour. Why? They never went to lake. They were afraid of it. All children are afraid. But that night... something called them. Something pulled them there.

**LEENA:** Did anyone see them leave the house?

**RAGHUNATH:** Ira was cooking inside. I was in field. When she looked up, they were gone. No sound. No goodbye. Just... vanished.

**LEENA:** Where is Aarav now?

**RAGHUNATH:** (glances away) Safe. Away from here. The spirits might come back for him. He is the one who escaped. They don't like when one escapes.

**LEENA:** I need to talk to him. As a doctor. To help him.

**RAGHUNATH:** (firmly) No. He has suffered enough. Talking brings it back. He screams at night already. Let him forget. Let him live.

## POST-INTERVIEW ANALYSIS

### Key Information:
- Gauri had "bad dream" about twins calling her name - night before death
- Aarav was unusually quiet and watchful that day
- Children were afraid of lake, yet went there
- Aarav saw "two shadows" - consistent with Constable's report
- Parents don't know why children went to lake
- Aarav's location being protected by family

### Contradictions Found:
- Children were afraid of lake but went anyway - suggests external force or witnessed something
- "Something called them" - what could make scared children go?
- Family hiding Aarav's location - protective or hiding something?

### Red Herrings:
- Dream about twins calling Gauri - reinforces supernatural narrative
- Raghunath's genuine grief makes him seem innocent

### This Interview Unlocks:
- Need to interview mother (Meena More) for more details
- Aarav's location is key - someone knows where he is
- "Two shadows" needs more investigation

### Verification Status:
- Aarav's testimony critical - matches Constable's report
- Mother's account of evening needed
- Timeline of that day needs reconstruction
