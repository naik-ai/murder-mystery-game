## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Rangubai's hut is at the edge of the settlement, where the living meet the dead. She prepares bodies for cremation. She sits outside, smoking bidi, eyes clouded with age but sharp with seeing. The smell of neem and something else - ash, maybe death itself - hangs in the air.*

**LEENA:** Rangubai, I am-

**RANGUBAI:** I know who you are. Sarla's girl. The one who touches the sick but fears the dead.

**LEENA:** I don't fear-

**RANGUBAI:** (waves hand dismissively) Everyone fears. It is natural. Sit. I know why you came.

**LEENA:** (sits on the ground) You prepared the bodies. All six children.

**RANGUBAI:** (exhales smoke) All six. Yes. My hands cleaned them. My prayers sent them. I know death. I know what water does to a body. I know what time does. (pause) I know what is wrong.

**LEENA:** What was wrong?

**RANGUBAI:** (leans forward) The twins. Fifteen years ago. They were the first. Everyone said - drowned, accident, flash flood. But bodies that drown in flood look different. Battered. Bruised. Water throws them against things.

**LEENA:** And the twins?

**RANGUBAI:** Perfect. Like sleeping. No bruises from water. Only... (touches her own throat) ...here. Small marks. Like someone pressed. But the light was bad. No one looked close. Only me.

**LEENA:** You think someone strangled them?

**RANGUBAI:** (shakes head) Not strangle. Held. Under water. (demonstrates with hands) Push down, hold until stillness comes. Different marks. Deeper in throat, lighter on neck. I have seen it before. Long time ago. When a mother drowned her own child in the river. Same marks.

**LEENA:** Did you tell anyone?

**RANGUBAI:** (laughs bitterly) Tell who? The police who came for five minutes? The families who were crying too much to see? (becomes serious) There was one person I told. The old priest. Pandit Dattatray.

**LEENA:** What did he say?

**RANGUBAI:** He said he knew. He said... (stops, looks around nervously) He said the water knows what was done. He said heaven would forgive but the lake never would. And then... (voice drops to whisper) ...then he died too. Two weeks. Heart stopped in his sleep.

**LEENA:** You think his death was connected?

**RANGUBAI:** I think when you see too much in this village, you die soon. (stubs out bidi) That is why I say nothing. Seventy-five years I have lived by saying nothing.

**LEENA:** The other children. The Karande siblings. The More girl. What did you see on them?

**RANGUBAI:** (closes eyes, remembering) Karande children - same as twins. No struggle marks. Peaceful faces but terrified bodies. Eyes wanted to be open. Someone closed them. Forced them closed. (shudders) And smell. Wrong smell.

**LEENA:** What smell?

**RANGUBAI:** Lake water smells like lake. Mud, fish, rot. But those children... under the lake smell... there was another smell. Faint. (shakes head) Like something had been burning nearby. I thought maybe someone had a fire. Or maybe... (trails off, waves hand dismissively) Old woman's imagination. Seventy-five years of death have confused my nose.

**LEENA:** The More girl?

**RANGUBAI:** Same strange smell. Faint. Under the water smell. And something else. Her hands. (holds up own hands) When someone tries to run, they fall. Hands get scraped. Her palms were torn. She ran. She fell. (pause, falls silent) Some things I keep to myself. The dead speak in their own way. I have listened long enough to know when not to repeat what they say.

**LEENA:** Why haven't you told anyone this?

**RANGUBAI:** (opens eyes, stares at Leena) Because I want to live, child. The ones who killed those children - they are still here. In this village. Watching. Waiting. If they knew I saw... (shakes head) The dead are gone. I cannot help them. But I can help myself by staying quiet. Until now.

**LEENA:** Why tell me now?

**RANGUBAI:** (strange smile) Because you are Sarla's daughter. Because your mother knows things too. Because maybe... maybe it is time for truth. I am old. Death comes for me soon anyway. What can they do to an old woman who already has one foot in the other world?
