## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**SARPANCH:** (standing behind desk, not offering seat) CID officer, yes? My constable informed me. What is this about?

**ARJUN:** Three incidents of child deaths in fifteen years. I'm reviewing the pattern.

**SARPANCH:** Pattern? (laughs dismissively) Pune people see patterns everywhere. This is village, officer. Things happen differently here.

**ARJUN:** Six children are dead. All siblings or twins. All at the same lake. All ruled suicide or accident. That's not a pattern?

**SARPANCH:** (sits down, sighs) Sit. I will explain.

**ARJUN:** (sits)

**SARPANCH:** Korde Tal - the lake - has been here since before my grandfather's grandfather. Stories of that lake are even older. Sometimes it gives water, sometimes it takes lives. This is how village works. We do not question the lake.

**ARJUN:** So you believe in the curse?

**SARPANCH:** Believe? Officer saheb, I don't need to believe. I have seen. My own cousin - when I was young - he went swimming in that lake during full moon. He came back different. Stopped talking. Stared at walls. Within a year, he was dead.

**ARJUN:** What killed him?

**SARPANCH:** (shrugs) Fever. But the lake took his spirit first. The body just followed.

**ARJUN:** And the twin girls? The Karande children? The More children? The lake took them too?

**SARPANCH:** The twins' death woke something in that lake. Something that was sleeping. Now it takes children in pairs. Siblings. Those connected by blood. The lake likes to take two at a time now.

**ARJUN:** That's a very specific curse.

**SARPANCH:** Curses are specific, officer. They have rules. Ghosts have rules. Only city people think death is random. Here, we know better.

**ARJUN:** Has anyone tried to... break the curse? Do something about it?

**SARPANCH:** (laughs bitterly) The zamindar tried. Every year he does puja. Brings priests from Kolhapur. Spends lakhs. Nothing changes. You cannot buy off a curse.

**ARJUN:** Why does the zamindar take such interest?

**SARPANCH:** (careful pause) Old family, officer. They feel responsible for the land. For everyone on it. It is... how to say... paternalistic duty.

**ARJUN:** Seems like expensive paternalism.

**SARPANCH:** Gadkari Saheb is good man. His wife... (trails off)

**ARJUN:** His wife?

**SARPANCH:** Nothing. She is also good. Very strict. Traditional. She does not like outsiders asking questions about family matters.

**ARJUN:** I'm not asking about family matters. I'm asking about dead children.

**SARPANCH:** (stands up) And I have told you. The curse. The lake. These are the answers. If you want something else, you will not find it here. We are simple village people. We don't have your city mysteries.

**ARJUN:** One more question. The boy who survived the last incident. Aarav More. Where is he?

**SARPANCH:** (slight hesitation) Gone. His mother's people took him. For safety.

**ARJUN:** For safety from what?

**SARPANCH:** The curse might come back for him. He saw the ghosts and lived. That is not natural. He needs to be far from here.

**ARJUN:** Do you know where?

**SARPANCH:** (shakes head) I am sarpanch, not postmaster. I do not track where families send their children.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- Sarpanch dismissive but clearly knows more
- Zamindar's yearly puja is expensive - strange for distant tragedy
- Vasundhara described as "strict" and dislikes questions
- Aarav's location hidden by village
- Sarpanch has personal superstitious experience (cousin)

### Contradictions:
- Says he doesn't track children but knows Aarav is "gone"
- Dismissive of investigation but nervous about zamindar family questions
- Very quick to end conversation when family is mentioned

### Hidden Element:
- Sarpanch possibly bribed by kiln operation (Phase 2 will reveal)
- He's protecting both Wada and Bhatti interests
