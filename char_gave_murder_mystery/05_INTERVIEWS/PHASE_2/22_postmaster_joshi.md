## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*The post office is a single room with barred windows. Dusty ledgers line the shelves. Postmaster Ramesh Bhat sits behind his counter, spectacles on nose, studying Arjun with curiosity.*

**POSTMASTER:** CID officer wants to see a postmaster? This is unusual. Usually it's the other way around.

**ARJUN:** I'm interested in money orders. Specific patterns of payment.

**POSTMASTER:** (adjusts spectacles) Money orders are private matters. I cannot share details without proper authorization.

**ARJUN:** I'm investigating the deaths of six children over fifteen years. If there's a pattern of payment connected to those deaths, I need to know.

**POSTMASTER:** (long pause) You are careful with your words. I respect that. (looks around, then leans forward) What pattern are you asking about?

**ARJUN:** Regular payments from kiln families to victims' families. Starting after each death.

**POSTMASTER:** (sighs) I wondered when someone would notice. Forty years I have been here. I see everything. I say nothing. But... six children. Even I have limits.

**ARJUN:** Tell me what you've seen.

**POSTMASTER:** The first pattern started fifteen years ago. Right after the twin girls drowned. Money started coming to Kalyani - the mother - from the Wada. Regular. Monthly. I assumed - everyone assumed - the zamindar was being charitable.

**ARJUN:** Just the zamindar?

**POSTMASTER:** Later, small amounts from Raut. The father, Vishnu. To Kalyani and also to... (checks old ledger) ...to Sarla Shirke. Not much. But regular.

**ARJUN:** Sarla? Why her?

**POSTMASTER:** I don't know. She was Kalyani's friend. Maybe to help take care of her.

**ARJUN:** And after the Karande children?

**POSTMASTER:** Same thing. Money to the Karande family started coming from Raut. Also from... (hesitates) ...anonymous sender. Cash deposit. I never saw who brought it.

**ARJUN:** Anonymous?

**POSTMASTER:** It happens. Someone comes late in the day, leaves cash with instruction, doesn't give name. I process it. Rules say I should record sender, but... (shrugs) ...village ways.

**ARJUN:** And the More family?

**POSTMASTER:** After four months, money started. Raut family again. And anonymous again. Same pattern. Always same amounts. Always same dates. First of every month.

**ARJUN:** Why would kiln families pay victims' families?

**POSTMASTER:** (removes spectacles, rubs eyes) I have asked myself this many times. Charity doesn't work this way. Charity is public. This is hidden. Systematic. It looks like... (careful) ...guilt. Or payment for silence.

**ARJUN:** Did Madhav Gokhale ever send money?

**POSTMASTER:** (thinks) No. Never directly. But the anonymous money... I noticed something. The paper it was wrapped in. Old newspaper. Had kiln advertisement at the bottom. Gokhale Brothers Bricks.

**ARJUN:** You think Madhav was the anonymous sender?

**POSTMASTER:** I think someone at that kiln was. Could be anyone. But Madhav... he's the one with money to spare. Devrao keeps accounts clean. Madhav handles the cash.

**ARJUN:** Why haven't you told anyone this before?

**POSTMASTER:** (puts spectacles back on) Tell whom? Constable Mohan Ghadge, who closes cases in two days? Sarpanch Vilas Patre, who takes money from everyone? (shakes head) I am old man. I want to finish my service, take my pension, go live with my daughter in Pune. Speaking up gets you trouble. Silence gets you pension.

**ARJUN:** But you're speaking now.

**POSTMASTER:** (looks at him) Because you are CID. Because you came from outside. Because maybe - finally - someone will actually look at what happened. Those children deserved justice. All six of them.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- PAYMENT PATTERNS confirmed across all three timelines
- Wada pays Kalyani (T1 connection)
- Raut pays all victim families (knew something about all deaths)
- ANONYMOUS payments wrapped in PATIL KILN NEWSPAPER
- Anonymous = likely Madhav Gokhale
- Payments are structured like guilt/silence money
- Started after each death, continued monthly
- Village authority figures complicit in cover-up

### Contradictions:
- Payments called "charity" but structured like hush money
- Anonymous sender used kiln newspaper - careless slip
- Postmaster knew for years but said nothing - self-preservation

### Hidden Element:
- Money trail connects kiln to murders
- Madhav is paying to keep families quiet
- Raut family knows more than they admit
- Paper trail exists if properly investigated
