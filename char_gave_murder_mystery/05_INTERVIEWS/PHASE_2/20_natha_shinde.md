## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Prakash is loading bricks onto a truck. He is shorter than average, muscular from years of labor. When he sees Arjun, he stops. His eyes dart to the main building, as if looking for someone.*

**ARJUN:** Prakash Kore?

**PRAKASH:** (gruff) Yes. What do you want?

**ARJUN:** CID Pune. I'm asking about the night operations at the lake.

**PRAKASH:** (freezes momentarily, then resumes loading) What operations? There are no operations at the lake.

**ARJUN:** I've been told trucks go there at night. Your trucks.

**PRAKASH:** (doesn't look at him) Who told you? People talk nonsense. We deliver bricks. That's all.

**ARJUN:** Where do you deliver at night?

**PRAKASH:** We don't deliver at night. Kiln work is daytime work.

**ARJUN:** But you work at night sometimes?

**PRAKASH:** (pause) Maintenance. Sometimes. The kiln doesn't stop. Fires need watching.

**ARJUN:** On September 14th, four months ago. Where were you?

**PRAKASH:** (sets down bricks, wipes hands) September? How should I remember? Four months is long time. I was here. Working. Like always.

**ARJUN:** That's the night the More children went missing. Gauri was found dead. Aarav survived.

**PRAKASH:** (face carefully blank) Sad thing. Curse took another one. Nothing to do with me.

**ARJUN:** The boy described two figures. Adult-sized. One taller, one shorter.

**PRAKASH:** (shifts weight) Ghosts come in all sizes, they say. I wouldn't know. I don't go to the lake.

**ARJUN:** He said they smelled like the kiln. Like smoke and fire.

**PRAKASH:** (first sign of nervousness) Children imagine things. Boy was scared. Probably confused.

**ARJUN:** (steps closer) Where does Madhav Gokhale go at night?

**PRAKASH:** (doesn't meet eyes) I don't watch Madhav-saheb. He's the boss. He goes where he wants.

**ARJUN:** But you go with him sometimes?

**PRAKASH:** I drive trucks. I go where he tells me to go. That's my job.

**ARJUN:** So if he told you to go to the lake at night-

**PRAKASH:** (quickly) He never told me that. There's nothing at the lake. Just water. And ghosts. And curse.

**ARJUN:** You believe in the curse?

**PRAKASH:** (meets eyes for first time, something hard there) Everyone believes. It's easier that way.

**ARJUN:** Easier than what?

**PRAKASH:** (looks away) Easier than asking questions. Easier than knowing things you shouldn't know. (begins loading again) I have work. Unless you're arresting me, I have to finish.

**ARJUN:** One more thing. Your wife, Lata. Does she know about the night work?

**PRAKASH:** (stops dead) Leave my wife out of this. She knows nothing. She is good woman. She stays home.

**ARJUN:** She told her neighbor she's worried about you. Says you come home late. Can't sleep. Have nightmares.

**PRAKASH:** (voice low, dangerous) People should mind their own business. My wife should mind hers. Tell the neighbors to do the same. (looks directly at Arjun) Some questions are dangerous, saheb. For everyone.
