## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Leena's childhood home. Small but clean. Sarla is preparing dinner. She knows why her daughter is here. The tension between duty and secrecy is visible in every movement.*

**LEENA:** Aai, where is Aarav More?

**SARLA:** (doesn't stop cooking) Why do you ask?

**LEENA:** Because he's the only witness. Because everyone is lying about where he is. Because I think you know.

**SARLA:** (long pause) Eat something first. You are too thin. City food has ruined you.

**LEENA:** Aai. Please.

**SARLA:** (sits down, faces her daughter) If I tell you, it stays with us. That child has suffered enough. He doesn't need CID officers and constables treating him like criminal.

**LEENA:** I won't bring the police. Just me. I promise.

**SARLA:** He is here. In Vasti. I am keeping him. His mother brought him to me the night after... after his sister was found. She said "Sarla-mavshi, save my son. They will come for him too."

**LEENA:** Who will come for him?

**SARLA:** (looks at her hands) She didn't say. But she was terrified. Real terror, not ghost fear. She has not visited once since. Too scared to lead anyone here.

**LEENA:** I need to talk to him.

**SARLA:** He doesn't speak much. He screams at night. He thinks the ghosts will find him. But... (hesitates) ...some things he said make me think it wasn't ghosts.

**LEENA:** What things?

**SARLA:** He talks about smell. Burning smell. Kiln smell. He talks about a truck. He talks about two big shadows, not small girls. (looks at Leena) Ghosts don't smell like bhatti. Ghosts don't drive trucks.

**LEENA:** Will you let me see him?

**SARLA:** Tomorrow. In daylight. Not now - he doesn't sleep until very late. Too scared.

**LEENA:** Aai... the twins. The first ones. Ira and Asha. People in Vasti told me about the zamindar and Kalyani.

**SARLA:** (stiffens) What people?

**LEENA:** Everyone. They said you know more. You were friends with Kalyani. You were there.

**SARLA:** (gets up, returns to cooking) That was long time ago. Different life.

**LEENA:** Aai, those twins might have been murdered too. By someone at Wada. If there's a connection-

**SARLA:** (turns sharply) There is no connection! Those deaths are different. The twins... (stops, controls herself) The twins died because of old sins. The new children died because of new sins. Don't mix them.

**LEENA:** How do you know they're different?

**SARLA:** (long silence, then quiet) Because I saw Kalyani the night the twins died. Before anyone knew. Before the bodies were found. She came to my door. Couldn't speak - she was already mute by then. But she drew in the dirt. Drew a woman in white. Drew a man with beard. Pointed toward Wada.

**LEENA:** She saw who killed them?

**SARLA:** She didn't see. But she knew. A mother knows. The zamindar's wife had been... watching her. Watching the twins. And there was an old servant - Raghoba - he had been following the children for days before they died. Kalyani noticed. She was going to take them away, to her sister's village. But she waited one day too long.

**LEENA:** Did Kalyani ever accuse anyone?

**SARLA:** How? She cannot speak. And who would believe a Vasti woman against zamindar's wife? The police? The sarpanch? (bitter laugh) They would have put HER in jail for making trouble.

**LEENA:** And you never told anyone?

**SARLA:** (sits down heavily) I told Kalyani to forget. I told her the children were gone and nothing would bring them back. I told her to take the money from Wada and survive. I was trying to protect her. (voice breaks) I was protecting everyone but those dead children.

**LEENA:** The money from Wada. It still comes?

**SARLA:** Every month. Has come for fifteen years. The zamindar sends it through the postmaster. Thinks it is charity. Guilt. But his wife... I think his wife sends it to keep Kalyani quiet. Buying silence one month at a time.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- AARAV IS IN VASTI with Sarla - location confirmed
- Aarav talks of KILN SMELL and TRUCK and TWO BIG SHADOWS
- His mother said "they will come for him too" - knew it was murder
- T1 SEPARATE from T2-T3: "old sins" vs "new sins"
- Kalyani KNEW killers: drew woman in white (Vasundhara) and man with beard (Raghoba?)
- Raghoba was FOLLOWING the twins before they died
- Money from Wada is silence money, not charity
- Sarla has kept Kalyani's secret for 15 years

### Contradictions:
- If Kalyani was going to take twins away but "waited one day too long" - someone knew her plan
- Money sent by zamindar but possibly at Vasundhara's direction - who controls it?

### Hidden Element:
- Clear confirmation: T1 and T2-T3 are DIFFERENT killers
- Kalyani identified Vasundhara and Raghoba (through drawing)
- Aarav's testimony will break the ghost story
