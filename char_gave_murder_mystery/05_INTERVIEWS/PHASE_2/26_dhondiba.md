## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Raghoba is a large man, still strong despite his age. He sits outside the servants' quarters, polishing brass lamps for the Wada's evening prayers. His hands are calloused, his movements practiced. He does not rise when the CID officer approaches.*

**ARJUN:** Raghoba? I'm from CID. I need to ask some questions.

**RAGHOBA:** (continues polishing) CID asking servants now. Times have changed.

**ARJUN:** You've served the Gadkari family for how long?

**RAGHOBA:** All my life. My father served before me. His father before him. We are Wada people. We are born here. We die here.

**ARJUN:** You were here fifteen years ago. When the twin girls drowned.

**RAGHOBA:** (polishing stops briefly) Yes. Terrible day. Terrible thing. The whole Wada was in mourning.

**ARJUN:** Why was the Wada in mourning? The girls were from Vasti settlement. Not connected to the zamindar's family.

**RAGHOBA:** (pause) Every death is mourned. Every child is precious. Gadkari Saheb has big heart for all people, high and low.

**ARJUN:** You helped search for them that night, didn't you? The police report mentions your name.

**RAGHOBA:** Yes. I was... I was with the search party. We looked everywhere. Found them in the morning. In the lake. (voice catches, continues polishing harder)

**ARJUN:** Strange that you're still emotional about it after fifteen years.

**RAGHOBA:** Some things you don't forget. Small bodies in the water. Their mother screaming. Gopal-bhau collapsing. These memories don't fade.

**ARJUN:** Tell me about Kalyani. The mother. Did you know her before the children died?

**RAGHOBA:** (shifts position) Everyone knew everyone. It's small place. She was... she was from Vasti. Young woman. Married to Gopal who worked at kilns.

**ARJUN:** And her relationship with the Wada? With your employers?

**RAGHOBA:** (pause, continues polishing) What relationship? She was village woman. Wada is Wada. There is... distance.

**ARJUN:** Then why did Vasundhara-bai take special interest in her? In her children?

**RAGHOBA:** (hands stop, voice hardens) Who told you that?

**ARJUN:** Several people mentioned it. The lady of the house paying for the children's education. Their clothing. Giving Kalyani work. That's unusual generosity for "distance."

**RAGHOBA:** Bai is generous. Dharmic. She does charity. For temple, for poor, for children. This is not unusual. This is duty.

**ARJUN:** The morning you found the bodies. You were the first to spot them. How?

**RAGHOBA:** I was... I was checking the lake edge. Walking. Looking. And I saw.

**ARJUN:** But the constable's report says you found them in the northern area. That's not where search parties were looking. That's far from the usual path.

**RAGHOBA:** (long pause) I had... I had feeling. Sometimes you have feeling where to look.

**ARJUN:** A feeling. After searching all night, you suddenly had a feeling to check a remote area. And there they were.

**RAGHOBA:** I found them. That's what matters. (stands abruptly) I have work. The lamps need to be ready before sunset.

**ARJUN:** One more question. The night the twins died - where were you exactly? Not during the search. Before. When they actually went to the lake.

**RAGHOBA:** (back turned) I was at Wada. Doing my duties. I am always at Wada.

**ARJUN:** Can anyone confirm that?

**RAGHOBA:** (walks toward Wada, voice drifting back) Ask Bai. She will tell you. I was here. I am always here.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- Raghoba found the T1 bodies in unusual location
- "Had a feeling" where to look - suspicious
- Extremely uncomfortable discussing Vasundhara-Kalyani connection
- Defensive about his whereabouts the night of T1
- Emotional reaction after 15 years - guilt?
- Points to Vasundhara for alibi - she is mastermind

### Contradictions:
- Claims "distance" between Wada and Vasti, but Vasundhara's charity disproves this
- Found bodies in remote area search parties weren't checking
- Too emotional about deaths he claims were just tragic accident

### Hidden Element:
- Raghoba is T1 killer - executed Vasundhara's orders
- Knew exactly where bodies were because he put them there
- 15 years of guilt weighing on him
- Will fully confess in Phase 4 (Interview 47)
