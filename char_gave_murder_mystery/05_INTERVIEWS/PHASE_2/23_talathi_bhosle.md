## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*The talathi's office is cramped, filled with maps and land documents. Sathe is a bureaucrat through and through - cautious, procedural, protecting himself.*

**TALATHI:** You want land records for the kiln area? May I ask why?

**ARJUN:** Connected to an investigation. Child deaths in Talegaon.

**TALATHI:** (confused) Land records... and child deaths? What is the connection?

**ARJUN:** I'm trying to understand the power structures. Who owns what. Who transferred land to whom.

**TALATHI:** (pulls out large register) This is unusual request. But you are CID. I cannot refuse. (opens to relevant section) What specifically?

**ARJUN:** The Gokhale family. Devrao and Madhav. Their kiln land.

**TALATHI:** Gokhale Brothers Bricks. Yes. Here. (points) Original land grant from pre-Independence. British era license. Family has been here for generations. Devrao Gokhale is current registered owner.

**ARJUN:** Any transfers in the last fifteen years?

**TALATHI:** (flips pages) Yes. Actually. Here. Ten years ago. Large parcel transferred from... (squints) ...from zamindar estate to Gokhale family. Below market rate.

**ARJUN:** Zamindar sold land to Gokhales? Why?

**TALATHI:** Document says "family settlement." But... (hesitates)

**ARJUN:** But?

**TALATHI:** Zamindar was not selling land. He was accumulating. For decades. This is the only transfer OUT in all my records. And it went to Madhav Gokhale specifically, not to Devrao or the family trust.

**ARJUN:** Madhav personally received land from the zamindar?

**TALATHI:** Yes. And immediately, the land was converted from agricultural to industrial. For "kiln expansion." But... (flips to another section) ...here's something strange. The land includes Korde Tal common land. That area is protected. You cannot convert talbed land to industrial. Someone approved it anyway.

**ARJUN:** Who approved it?

**TALATHI:** Revenue office. Surveyor Bendre. He's retired now. But he signed off on the conversion despite regulations.

**ARJUN:** Was there payment recorded?

**TALATHI:** (points at small notation) "Facilitation fee." Twenty thousand rupees. To revenue office account. But... (looks around) ...I have heard the actual amount was much higher. Off the books.

**ARJUN:** Bribery.

**TALATHI:** (holds up hands) I didn't say that. I am land records only. I don't know about payments outside my records.

**ARJUN:** Any other unusual transfers? To any of the kiln families?

**TALATHI:** (checks) Kore family received small parcel five years ago. Also from zamindar. Also below market. And Raut... Raut father received nothing. But here - after his death, his son Nilesh somehow has clear title to disputed land. The dispute was with... (reads) ...Karande family.

**ARJUN:** Karande? The family whose children died?

**TALATHI:** (nods slowly) Harish Karande had claim on that land. Old family dispute. After his children died, he withdrew the claim. Document says "voluntary settlement." But there's no record of payment to him.

**ARJUN:** So a grieving father gave up his land claim for nothing?

**TALATHI:** That's what the paper says. Whether it's true... (shrugs) ...I just keep the records. I don't interpret.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- Zamindar transferred land to Madhav (not Devrao) 10 years ago
- Land includes protected talbed area - illegally converted
- Surveyor Bendre approved illegal conversion (bribed)
- Kore also received land from zamindar
- Karande family GAVE UP land claim after children died - paid off?
- All land transactions benefit kiln network
- Paper trail shows corruption and connections

### Contradictions:
- "Family settlement" for sale that only benefits Madhav
- "Voluntary settlement" by grieving parents for no compensation
- Talbed land converted through bribes

### Hidden Element:
- Zamindar is paying off kiln people - but why?
- Possible: kiln helps hide something for Wada
- Or: separate networks using each other
- Karande gave up land = silenced after children killed
