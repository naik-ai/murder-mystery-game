## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**ARJUN:** Thank you for meeting me, Madhav-saheb.

**MADHAV:** (warm smile) Of course, of course. Anything to help. This curse business is very bad for everyone. Very bad for the village. I won't lie - bad for business also. Workers are scared. Some have left.

**ARJUN:** How long have you been running the kiln?

**MADHAV:** My family has been in this business for three generations. My father started. My elder brother Devrao is the head of family. I manage the daily work. The boring work, as I call it. (laughs)

**ARJUN:** You and your brother both run it?

**MADHAV:** Devrao-dada handles the business side. Accounts, sales, contacts in the city. I am here on the ground. Workers, production, fuel supply. We are good team.

**ARJUN:** The More family - did you know them?

**MADHAV:** (expression shifts to sorrow) Everyone knows everyone here, saheb. Raghunath worked for us sometimes. Daily wage work. Good man. Hard worker. Very honest. What happened to his children... (shakes head) ...no parent should suffer like this.

**ARJUN:** Did his children ever come near the kiln?

**MADHAV:** Children come and go in village. We don't allow them inside - too dangerous, very hot. But they play around sometimes. All village children do.

**ARJUN:** Did you ever see Gauri or Aarav near the kiln?

**MADHAV:** (thinks) Maybe. I cannot say for certain. Many children look same at that age. But we always chase them away. For their safety.

**ARJUN:** What about the lake? Korde Tal? Do your workers go there?

**MADHAV:** (slight pause, then casual) The lake? No, no. The lake is cursed, everyone knows. We stay away. Workers stay away. No reason to go there.

**ARJUN:** The kiln produces waste. Ash, chemicals. Where does it go?

**MADHAV:** (confident) We have proper ash site. Rakhe, we call it. Other side of kiln. Away from water, away from village. We follow all rules. I can show you.

**ARJUN:** I'd like to see it.

**MADHAV:** Of course! Nothing to hide here, saheb. We are simple businessmen. Come, I will take you personally.

**ARJUN:** Later. First, some more questions. The night the More children died - where were you?

**MADHAV:** (without hesitation) Here. At the kiln. Night shift that day. We had big order to complete. I was here until morning. Prakash was with me. Many workers saw us.

**ARJUN:** Prakash?

**MADHAV:** Prakash Kore. He handles transport. Brings materials, takes finished bricks to buyers. Good man. Very reliable.

**ARJUN:** And he was with you all night?

**MADHAV:** Yes. Both of us. You can ask anyone. Ten, fifteen workers will tell you same thing.

**ARJUN:** The Karande children, eight years ago. Do you remember them?

**MADHAV:** (pauses, seems to think) Karande... yes, I remember. Very sad. Two children, brother and sister. Same thing - went to lake, drowned. That was when people started saying curse is real. Two incidents, same pattern.

**ARJUN:** Did you know that family?

**MADHAV:** Not closely. They lived in Talegaon. Different area. I heard about it like everyone else.

**ARJUN:** And the original twins? Fifteen years ago?

**MADHAV:** (crosses himself) That is when it started. Those poor girls. Flash flood took them. Some say they were unlucky. Some say... something else. After that, the lake changed. Became dark place. No one goes there now if they can help it.

**ARJUN:** You believe in the curse?

**MADHAV:** (measured) Saheb, I am a practical man. I believe in what I see. But I have lived here all my life. I have seen things that have no explanation. Three times now, children have died same way. Maybe science has answer. Maybe God has answer. I don't know. I just know - that lake is not a good place.

**ARJUN:** One last question. If someone wanted to go to the lake at night without being seen, how would they do it?

**MADHAV:** (eyes narrow slightly, then relaxes) I wouldn't know, saheb. I told you - I stay away from there. Everyone does. Only the spirits go to that lake at night.

## POST-INTERVIEW ANALYSIS

### Key Information:
- Madhav has immediate alibi ready (night shift with Prakash)
- Too smooth, too prepared
- Slight pause when lake mentioned
- Claims waste goes to Rakhe (official ash site)
- Denies any reason to go to lake
- Prakash Kore identified as close associate
- Knows all three incidents but claims distant connection

### Contradictions Found:
- "Nothing to hide" but slight hesitation on lake questions
- Alibi involves Prakash - who would be accomplice
- Workers would confirm alibi - but workers depend on him for jobs
- Too cooperative, too friendly - performing innocence

### Red Herrings:
- Seems genuinely helpful
- Provides logical explanations
- Curse belief seems sincere

### This Interview Unlocks:
- Need to verify alibi with workers (but they're unreliable)
- Need to interview Prakash Kore separately
- Need to inspect BOTH Rakhe AND the Tal for waste-burning evidence
- Need independent witness who doesn't work for Madhav

### Verification Status:
- Alibi needs independent verification
- Rakhe ash site needs inspection
- Tal needs inspection for illegal burning/disposal
- Prakash's testimony will likely match (they'd coordinate)
