## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Havaldar Phadke is young for his position. He smokes nervously, pacing near the police jeep. He keeps looking to make sure Constable Ghadge isn't nearby.*

**ARJUN:** You requested to speak with me privately. Why?

**PHADKE:** (smoking fast) Because Ghadge-saheb has been here thirty years. He has... arrangements. I am outsider. I see things differently.

**ARJUN:** What do you see?

**PHADKE:** The cases are wrong. All of them. Every child death. Wrong conclusions. Wrong rulings.

**ARJUN:** That's a serious accusation against a senior officer.

**PHADKE:** (laughs bitter) He is not officer. He is village man who wears uniform. He does what he is told. By sarpanch. By zamindar. By kiln people. Whoever has money and power, he does their bidding.

**ARJUN:** You have evidence of this?

**PHADKE:** I have eyes. I have brain. Four months ago, when the More children... when the girl died and boy nearly died... I went to scene before Ghadge. I saw things.

**ARJUN:** What things?

**PHADKE:** Footprints. Adult footprints. Near the water. Two sets. Going toward lake. Not coming back. But in report? No mention. Ghadge wrote "no signs of struggle, no witnesses."

**ARJUN:** Why didn't you file your own observation?

**PHADKE:** (throws cigarette) Because I am havaldar. He is senior. And when I raised question, he took me aside and said very clearly - "This village has traditions. We follow traditions. If you want to stay here, you follow too. If not, I can arrange transfer to Gadchiroli. You know what Gadchiroli is."

**ARJUN:** Naxal territory. Dangerous posting.

**PHADKE:** Exactly. So I shut up. I filed nothing. I let him write what he wanted. But it eats me. Every day it eats me.

**ARJUN:** The eight-year-old cases. Did Ghadge handle those the same way?

**PHADKE:** I wasn't here. But I read files. Same pattern. Minimal investigation. Quick closure. And always - always - the same ruling. Suicide or accident. Never murder. As if murder is not possible in this village.

**ARJUN:** The medical reports?

**PHADKE:** (bitter) What reports? Post-mortems were waived. "Family request." "Religious concerns." Convenient, no? No autopsy means no evidence. No evidence means no questions.

**ARJUN:** Who authorized the waiver?

**PHADKE:** Sub-Inspector More at taluka level. His family is connected to sarpanch. Everyone is connected to everyone here. It's like a web. You pull one thread, the whole thing shakes. So no one pulls.

**ARJUN:** You're pulling now. By talking to me.

**PHADKE:** (looks around) Because you are CID. Outside web. Maybe you can break it. Maybe you can't. But I cannot live with myself if I don't tell someone. Those children... someone killed them. And everyone here knows. Everyone is pretending ghosts did it because ghosts don't go to jail.

**ARJUN:** The kiln area. What do you know about that?

**PHADKE:** Trucks at night. Going wrong direction. Smoke from lake side on certain nights. Smell that shouldn't be there. I reported it to Ghadge. He said it's just brick-burning waste. Normal practice. But brick waste doesn't smell like burning plastic. Brick waste doesn't make your eyes water from half kilometer away.

**ARJUN:** Will you testify to this? Officially?

**PHADKE:** (long pause) If you can guarantee protection. Transfer after. Somewhere safe. Somewhere this web doesn't reach. Then yes. I will tell everything.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- Adult footprints at T3 scene - suppressed by Constable Ghadge
- Ghadge threatened Phadke with dangerous transfer
- Post-mortems waived through connected officials
- Trucks going wrong direction at night confirmed
- Chemical smell - not brick waste
- "Everyone knows" - conspiracy of silence

### Contradictions:
- Official reports say no evidence, but Phadke saw footprints
- "Brick burning waste" doesn't explain chemical smell
- Quick closures on every case - systematic cover-up

### Hidden Element:
- Police corruption at local and taluka level
- Ghadge is complicit in cover-up (knowingly or through fear)
- Phadke can be key witness if protected
- Web metaphor shows how interconnected the conspiracy is
