## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Lata is alone when Leena visits. Her husband Prakash is at the kiln. She's a thin woman with nervous eyes, constantly looking toward the door. She speaks quickly, as if afraid of being caught.*

**LATA:** He's not here. Prakash is at work.

**LEENA:** I wanted to speak with you actually. About your husband's... state of mind.

**LATA:** (wraps sari tighter) What do you mean?

**LEENA:** He works closely with Madhav Gokhale. Night shifts. Transport. I'm wondering if he's been... different lately.

**LATA:** (long pause) He doesn't sleep.

**LEENA:** Insomnia?

**LATA:** Not natural. It's like... he's afraid to sleep. He stays awake as long as he can. When he finally sleeps, he wakes up shouting. Sweating. Won't tell me what he dreams.

**LEENA:** Has he said anything about his work? About what he does at night?

**LATA:** He doesn't talk about work. Ever. When we were first married, he would tell me everything. What happened at kiln, who said what, small things. Now... nothing. Just silence and staring.

**LEENA:** When did this change?

**LATA:** (thinks) Four months ago. After those children died. The More children. He came home that night very late. His clothes were wet. I asked why. He said nothing. Just looked at me with... with empty eyes. Like something inside him had died.

**LEENA:** Wet clothes?

**LATA:** From the lake. That's what I thought. But why would he be at the lake in the middle of the night? (voice drops to whisper) I asked him. Once. He grabbed my wrist so hard it left bruise. Said never ask again. Said some things cannot be spoken. Said if I love our son, I will never ask again.

**LEENA:** Did he threaten you?

**LATA:** Not threaten. Warn. Like he was protecting me from something. From knowing. (tears form) I think... I think my husband did something terrible. And he can't live with it. But he can't speak it either.

**LEENA:** What do you think he did?

**LATA:** (shakes head frantically) I don't know. I don't want to know. He is father of my child. He provides. He doesn't drink like other men. He doesn't beat me. But there is something eating him. From inside. Something dark.

**LEENA:** Does he still work late nights? At the lake?

**LATA:** Sometimes. When Madhav-saheb calls. Prakash goes immediately. No questions. It's like... like Madhav has control over him. Power. Prakash is afraid of him. More afraid than of anything else.

**LEENA:** Has Madhav ever come here? To your house?

**LATA:** (nods) Once. After that night. After the children. He came to talk to Prakash privately. I listened through door. I heard... (stops)

**LEENA:** What did you hear?

**LATA:** Madhav said: "You did what was necessary. You saved us all. Now stop acting like a widow. What's done is done." And Prakash said... he said: "They were children. They were just children." And Madhav laughed. Laughed and said: "Children who would have destroyed everything. Now they're gone. Be grateful."

**LEENA:** That's very important. Would you testify to this?

**LATA:** (panic in eyes) Testify? Against Madhav? He would kill us. Kill our son. No. No, I can't. I shouldn't have said anything. Please. Please don't tell anyone I spoke to you.

**LEENA:** I won't use your name unless I have to. But what you've told me could save other children.

**LATA:** (crying) I know. I know. But I have to protect my own child first. That's what mothers do. We protect our own even if... even if others suffer.
