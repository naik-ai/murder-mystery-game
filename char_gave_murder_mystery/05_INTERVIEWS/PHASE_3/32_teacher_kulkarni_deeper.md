## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Shaila sits in her study, surrounded by books and papers. She's been expecting this conversation. On her desk is a notebook filled with handwritten observations.*

**SHAILA:** I've been keeping records. Since you came the first time. Writing down everything I remember. Everything I should have said years ago.

**LEENA:** May I see?

**SHAILA:** (hands over notebook) It's not organized. Just... thoughts. Observations. Things I noticed but didn't connect.

**LEENA:** (reading) You've listed all the children who died. With dates. And... activities before their deaths.

**SHAILA:** The pattern, Leena. It took me years to see it. Every child who died was... curious. Asking questions. Looking for things. Not just playing by the lake - that's what the curse story says - but actively investigating something.

**LEENA:** The twins? Ira and Asha? They were only eight.

**SHAILA:** (nods) Too young to investigate consciously. But their mother... Kalyani... she was asking things. Going to places. The children followed her sometimes. Maybe they saw something they shouldn't have seen.

**LEENA:** What was Kalyani investigating?

**SHAILA:** Not investigating exactly. But... questioning. Her position. Her children's position. She came to me once, asking about inheritance rights. About what happens if a father dies without a will. About whether children have claims even if parents are not married legally.

**LEENA:** She asked you about inheritance?

**SHAILA:** I teach some law for senior students. She knew I had the books. (pause) I didn't think much of it then. Thought maybe she was worried about her husband's kiln job, some benefit question. But now...

**LEENA:** Now you think it was about someone else's inheritance.

**SHAILA:** The timing, Leena. Three weeks after she asked me those questions, her children were dead. And she stopped speaking. Completely. For years. As if... as if whatever she was asking about got answered in the worst possible way.

**LEENA:** What about the Karande children? Neelam and Omkar?

**SHAILA:** (voice sad) My best students. So bright. So determined. Neelam especially. She wanted to be journalist. Said she wanted to expose corruption. (bitter smile) She was twelve years old and she wanted to expose corruption.

**LEENA:** And she found something to expose?

**SHAILA:** They found papers. In the old survey office. I told you before - they were excited about old documents. But I didn't tell you... (hesitates)

**LEENA:** What?

**SHAILA:** They came to me. The day before they died. With questions. About how to report talbed encroachment. Who to tell. Whether police could be trusted. I said... (voice breaks) ...I said be careful, don't get involved in adult matters. I said give me the papers and I'll look into it.

**LEENA:** Did they give you the papers?

**SHAILA:** (shakes head) Neelam said no. Said she didn't trust anyone fully. Said she would make copies and hide them in case something happened. (tears fall) She knew. At twelve years old, she knew something might happen. And I didn't take her seriously. I thought it was child imagination.

**LEENA:** The third timeline. Gauri and Aarav More. Did they come to you?

**SHAILA:** Not with papers. But Gauri asked something strange, few days before. Asked what medical waste is. Asked why hospitals burn things. Said she saw fires at night near the lake and they smelled wrong. I said ask your parents, it's probably nothing.

**LEENA:** Every time children asked questions, they died within days.

**SHAILA:** (crying openly now) I know. I know. And I should have said something. After the second time - after my own students died - I should have understood. But I told myself it was coincidence. I told myself the curse was real. Because if the curse was real, then I wasn't... I wasn't responsible for...

**LEENA:** (puts hand on Shaila's) You're not responsible. The killers are responsible.

**SHAILA:** But I could have stopped it. If I had asked questions myself. If I had made reports. If I had believed the children instead of dismissing them.

**LEENA:** You can still help. You can tell me everything you know. Everyone who might have been involved.

**SHAILA:** (wipes eyes, steels herself) The kiln people. Madhav Gokhale. Something wrong there. And the Wada... the zamindar's house... Vasundhara-bai. She changed after the first twins died. Became colder. More controlling. As if... as if she was holding something down. Holding something inside.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- Pattern confirmed: Questions → Death (all six children)
- Kalyani asked about inheritance before T1 - ties to deed/paternity
- Neelam (T2) anticipated danger, made copies of papers
- Gauri (T3) asked about medical waste burning
- Teacher dismissed all three timelines' warning signs
- Shaila identifies both power centers: Kiln and Wada

### Revelations:
- Kalyani's inheritance questions connect to affair/paternity
- Children weren't random victims - all were "knowing too much"
- Two separate threat vectors: Land (Wada) and Operations (Kiln)

### This Interview Unlocks:
- Deeper understanding of the pattern
- Connection between all three timelines
- Basis for Kalyani interview (#33)
