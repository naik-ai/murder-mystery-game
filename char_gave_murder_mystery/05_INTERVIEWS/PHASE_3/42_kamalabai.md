## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Vasundhara is a commanding presence even in old age. She sits straight, hands folded, watching Arjun with cold intelligence. She has refused to leave during the interview - this is her house, she says.*

**VASUNDHARA:** You've been speaking to my husband. To the servants. To that woman in Vasti. Asking questions about ancient history.

**ARJUN:** I'm investigating child deaths. All of them.

**VASUNDHARA:** The deaths were ruled. Years ago. Suicide. Drowning. Tragic but closed.

**ARJUN:** The rulings were wrong. There's evidence now.

**VASUNDHARA:** (slight smile) Evidence. How interesting. What kind of evidence surfaces after fifteen years?

**ARJUN:** Testimony. Documents. And I should mention - I've spoken to your husband. He's prepared to make a statement.

**VASUNDHARA:** (face flickers, then composes) My husband is an old man. Confused. His mind wanders to guilt and fantasy.

**ARJUN:** His mind seemed clear when he described the fight you had. The night before the twins died. About the trust deed.

**VASUNDHARA:** (long pause) There are family matters that are not police business. Property disputes. Inheritance questions. Normal in any family.

**ARJUN:** Normal families don't resolve inheritance disputes by murdering children.

**VASUNDHARA:** (stands abruptly) You forget yourself. This is accusation without proof. I could have you removed from this investigation. I have connections. Friends in appropriate places.

**ARJUN:** Your connections are why this wasn't investigated properly the first time. But I'm from outside your network. CID Pune. Different chain of command.

**VASUNDHARA:** (sits slowly, recalculating) What do you want? Money? Everyone wants money.

**ARJUN:** I want truth.

**VASUNDHARA:** (laughs, cold) Truth. How naive. Truth is whatever people with power say it is. Those children drowned. That is truth. Anything else is gossip and speculation.

**ARJUN:** Raghoba. Where was he the night the twins died?

**VASUNDHARA:** (slight hesitation) At the Wada. Where he always is. Doing his duties.

**ARJUN:** His bed was empty that night. The cook remembers. The cook also remembers you crying and shouting. Unusual behavior for someone as... composed as you.

**VASUNDHARA:** Servants gossip. It means nothing.

**ARJUN:** Kalyani heard Raghoba that night. Outside her hut. Saying "It's done."

**VASUNDHARA:** (face hardens) That woman would say anything. She hates me. For taking in her bastard children's charity. For paying for their education. For being the one with the legal marriage while she was just...

**ARJUN:** Just what?

**VASUNDHARA:** (catches herself) Nothing. She was nothing.

**ARJUN:** The children weren't nothing. They were your husband's blood. Healthy. Strong. Unlike your own son.

**VASUNDHARA:** (sharp) Do not speak of my son.

**ARJUN:** Was that the fear? That he would never inherit because these children would make claims? That your position would be undermined?

**VASUNDHARA:** (stands again, walks to window) You are constructing fantasy. A story that sounds dramatic but proves nothing. Where is your evidence? A confused old man? A bitter mistress? A cook who overheard crying? This is not case. This is gossip.

**ARJUN:** What about the trust deed? The one that was cancelled because the beneficiaries "died"?

**VASUNDHARA:** (turns, face controlled) Land matters are handled by talathi. Cancellations happen when there are no living beneficiaries. Administrative procedure. Nothing more.

**ARJUN:** Very convenient timing. Your husband creates deed acknowledging illegitimate children. You find out. You fight. Two days later, children are dead. Deed is cancelled.

**VASUNDHARA:** Coincidence. Unfortunate. But coincidence.

**ARJUN:** I don't think so. And I don't think any court will think so either.

**VASUNDHARA:** (moves closer, voice low) You are young. You have career ahead of you. This investigation will lead nowhere. It will only create enemies. Powerful enemies. Think carefully about what you are doing.

**ARJUN:** Is that a threat?

**VASUNDHARA:** (smiles, cold) It's advice. From someone who has lived long enough to understand how the world works. Some things are better left buried. Like children in lakes. Like inconvenient truths. Like ambitious officers who ask too many questions.
