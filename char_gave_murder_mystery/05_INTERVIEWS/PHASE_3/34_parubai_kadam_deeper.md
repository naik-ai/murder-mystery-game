## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Sarla sits in her kitchen, hands busy making rotis. Leena has come back with questions she should have asked years ago. Mother and daughter are finally having the conversation they've avoided.*

**LEENA:** Aai, you've known about Kalyani this whole time. You've protected Aarav. You've hidden things. Why?

**SARLA:** (kneading dough) Because knowing and proving are different things. Because powerful people don't go to jail - poor people who accuse them do.

**LEENA:** Tell me everything. From the beginning.

**SARLA:** (sighs) Kalyani was my friend. Before marriage, after marriage. We worked at Wada together. We saw things. (pause) I saw how Gadkari Saheb looked at her. How he would send her on small errands, separate from others. I tried to warn her. But she was young. Scared. Couldn't say no.

**LEENA:** You knew about the affair while it was happening?

**SARLA:** Everyone knew. Everyone pretended not to know. That's how it works. The rich do what they want. The poor pretend it's not happening. Until it becomes impossible to pretend.

**LEENA:** The pregnancy.

**SARLA:** Twins. Can you imagine? Not one baby to hide but two. Vasundhara... (shakes head) ...I saw her face when she found out. Not anger. Something colder. Calculation. Like she was solving a problem in her head.

**LEENA:** She planned the murders then? From when they were born?

**SARLA:** Not then. Then she just wanted them gone. Out of sight. The marriage to Gopal was her solution. Move them to Vasti. Pay for silence. Keep them invisible. But children grow. And they started looking too much like their father. And Gadkari Saheb... he started visiting Vasti. Playing with them. Bringing gifts. Making it obvious.

**LEENA:** The trust deed.

**SARLA:** That's what changed everything. When Kalyani told me about it - that Gadkari Saheb had put their names on land - I told her burn it. Destroy the paper. Make it like it never existed. She said no. Said it was proof her children were acknowledged. Said she would never use it but she wanted them to know someday. She thought it was gift. It was death sentence.

**LEENA:** How did Vasundhara find out about the deed?

**SARLA:** (hands stop) I told her.

**LEENA:** You what?

**SARLA:** (looks at daughter with old pain) Not deliberately. She came to me. Very friendly. Asking about Kalyani's health, her children's needs. Like she was concerned. I was stupid. I mentioned that at least they had some security now, that Gadkari Saheb had done right thing. The look on her face... (shudders) ...that look haunted me for years.

**LEENA:** You didn't know what she would do.

**SARLA:** I knew she would do something. I didn't know she would... (voice breaks) Two weeks later those babies were floating in the lake. And I knew. I knew my words had killed them.

**LEENA:** That's why you've been protecting Aarav. Guilt.

**SARLA:** Guilt and fear. What happened to those twins could happen to anyone who threatens her. Aarav is witness. Survivor. He sees things in dreams. Talks about "the men" who came. If Vasundhara or whoever killed the More children knew he was remembering...

**LEENA:** The More children were killed by different people. For different reason.

**SARLA:** (confused) What do you mean?

**LEENA:** The kiln. Madhav Gokhale. Medical waste burning. Gauri saw something. That's why she died. It's not connected to Vasundhara at all.

**SARLA:** (stares) Two killers? Two different...?

**LEENA:** The curse legend. Vasundhara created it to cover her crime. But then others used the same cover. Madhav realized he could kill witnesses and blame the ghost. That's why there were three incidents. Two different conspiracies using the same story.

**SARLA:** (sits down heavily) All these years I thought... I thought it was all the Wada. All Vasundhara. But the kiln...

**LEENA:** The kiln is separate. You didn't cause those deaths. You only... (stops herself)

**SARLA:** I only caused the first one. Only two children. Only my friend's babies. (crying) Only that.
