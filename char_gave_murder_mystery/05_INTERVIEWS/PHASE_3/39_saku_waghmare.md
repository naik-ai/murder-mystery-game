## PRE-INTERVIEW NOTES
Leena approaches Sunita carefully. Sunita is a poor woman who depends on kiln work. She brings food to workers twice daily and has done so for twenty years. She sees and hears things but has never spoken because she fears losing her livelihood. Leena, being from Vasti herself, might be trusted.

## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**LEENA:** Sunita-mavshi, do you remember me? I am Sarla's daughter. From Vasti.

**SUNITA:** (surprised) Sarla's girl? The one who became doctor?

**LEENA:** Yes, mavshi.

**SUNITA:** (softens) I remember you. Small thing, running around. Now look at you. Doctor-bai.

**LEENA:** Mavshi, I need to ask you some things. About the kiln.

**SUNITA:** (immediately tenses) I am poor woman. I don't make trouble. I do my work and go home.

**LEENA:** I am not here to make trouble for you. I am trying to find truth about the children who died.

**SUNITA:** (looks around nervously) What children? The curse took them. Everyone knows.

**LEENA:** Mavshi, you bring food to workers. Morning and evening. For twenty years. You see things. You hear things.

**SUNITA:** (quickly) I see nothing. I hear nothing. I am old woman. Eyes are weak. Ears are weak.

**LEENA:** Gauri More. The girl who died four months ago. You knew her?

**SUNITA:** (expression cracks) Gauri... yes. I knew her. Sweet child. She would smile at me when I passed her house. Sometimes she would wave. Such a good girl.

**LEENA:** She died, mavshi. Someone killed her. Not a ghost. A person.

**SUNITA:** (whispers) Don't say such things. Madhav-saheb will...

**LEENA:** Madhav-saheb will what?

**SUNITA:** (catches herself) Nothing. I said nothing.

**LEENA:** Mavshi, I am from Vasti. Like you. I know what it is to be scared of powerful people. But a child is dead. A good child who smiled at you. Don't you want justice for her?

**SUNITA:** (long pause, internal struggle visible) Justice? What is justice for people like us? The powerful do what they want. We suffer and stay quiet.

**LEENA:** If you know something, tell me. I promise no one will know it came from you.

**SUNITA:** (looks around again, then leans closer) You promise? On your mother's head?

**LEENA:** On my mother's head.

**SUNITA:** (whispers) I heard them talking. Madhav-saheb and Prakash. Few days after the children died. Late evening. I was leaving with empty vessels. They were behind the storage shed. They didn't see me.

**LEENA:** What did they say?

**SUNITA:** Madhav-saheb was angry. Very angry. I never saw him like that. He was saying... he was saying "those children saw us." Over and over. "Those children saw us."

**LEENA:** And Prakash?

**SUNITA:** Prakash said "it is done now, forget it." He said "what is done cannot be undone." Then Madhav-saheb said... (hesitates)

**LEENA:** Tell me.

**SUNITA:** He said "the boy is still alive." And Prakash said "he is child, who will believe him? He thinks he saw ghosts. Let him think that."

**LEENA:** Anything else?

**SUNITA:** Then they laughed. Both of them. It was not good laugh. It was... cold. Like they were laughing at something secret. I ran away after that. I was too scared to hear more.

**LEENA:** Sunita-mavshi, did you ever see Madhav-saheb or Prakash going toward the lake? At night?

**SUNITA:** (nods slowly) Many times. With the truck. After dark. I thought... I thought they were burning waste. The Rakhe site is other direction, but I thought maybe they have other place. I never asked. Not my business.

**LEENA:** How many times?

**SUNITA:** Many. Once, twice a month maybe. For years. Always at night. Always same truck.

**LEENA:** Did anyone else see this?

**SUNITA:** Dinesh maybe. The night watchman. But he is scared man. More scared than me. He thinks the lights he sees are ghosts. Easier to believe in ghosts than to see what is really happening.

**LEENA:** Mavshi, this is very important. You may have to tell this to police.

**SUNITA:** (terrified) No! No police! Madhav-saheb will know. He will throw me out. My children will starve. Please, you promised!

**LEENA:** I promised no one will know it came from you. I will keep that promise. But this truth must come out somehow.

**SUNITA:** (crying quietly) I should have said something before. Years ago. Maybe those children would be alive. But I was scared. I am still scared. What kind of person stays quiet when children die?

**LEENA:** A person who is trying to survive. Don't blame yourself, mavshi. Blame the men who did this.
