## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Ajit stands by his JCB, cleaning grease from his hands. He's a practical man - focused on work, uncomfortable with questions. His yard has three old earthmovers and a storage shed.*

**AJIT:** CID. (spits to the side) What now?

**ARJUN:** The talbed excavation in the protected area. Your machines. Your drivers.

**AJIT:** (shrugs) I rent machines. Where clients use them is their business. I don't ask questions.

**ARJUN:** Convenient. So when Madhav Gokhale rents your JCB for illegal mining, you just don't notice?

**AJIT:** (stiffens) I never said Madhav's name. You said it.

**ARJUN:** I have his survey report. Your equipment was used. For years.

**AJIT:** (walks to water tap, washes hands slowly) What do you want? Money? Everyone wants money. Tell me number and go.

**ARJUN:** I want truth. About the mining. About what you saw.

**AJIT:** (dries hands, faces Arjun) Truth is expensive here. People who deal in truth end up floating in the lake. Ask the children. Oh wait - you can't. They're dead.

**ARJUN:** You knew the children were killed?

**AJIT:** I knew they saw things. Everyone who sees things in this village ends up dead or silent. I chose silent. I'm still breathing.

**ARJUN:** What did you see?

**AJIT:** (lights bidi, smokes) I saw nothing. I was paid to see nothing. Just like I'm being paid now. Just like everyone is paid.

**ARJUN:** But the mining happened. Your machines worked that land.

**AJIT:** (nods slowly) Years ago. Twelve, thirteen years. Protected talbed, yes. Good earth underneath. Worth money. Madhav had the plan. His brother Devrao was against it - too much risk, he said. But Madhav went ahead anyway. Used my machines. Paid well. I didn't ask what he was doing with the material.

**ARJUN:** It went to the kiln.

**AJIT:** It went somewhere. Mixed with other materials. Became bricks. Good bricks. Strong bricks. Built half the new buildings in Satara district. (bitter smile) Government buildings too. Courts. Police stations. Built with stolen earth.

**ARJUN:** And when Raghav Nimkar started investigating?

**AJIT:** (face hardens) I told Madhav to pay him off. Just like he paid everyone else. But Madhav said some people can't be bought. Said some people are problems that need different solutions.

**ARJUN:** You knew Nimkar would be killed?

**AJIT:** I didn't KNOW. I suspected. When he died of "snakebite" I wasn't surprised. When his wife died asking questions, I wasn't surprised. I stopped being surprised long ago.

**ARJUN:** The children. Did you participate in their deaths?

**AJIT:** (slams hand on JCB) I dig dirt. That's what I do. I don't kill children. I have children myself. (voice drops) But I know who does. And I know why. And I've kept silent because speaking is dying in this place.

**ARJUN:** You're speaking now.

**AJIT:** Because you're CID. Because maybe you can actually do something. Or maybe you'll end up in the lake too. Either way, I'm tired of carrying this.

**ARJUN:** The waste burning. What do you know?

**AJIT:** Newer operation. Last few years. I'm not involved - that's Madhav's thing. But I've smelled it. Everyone has. Chemical smell at night. Smoke that makes eyes water. They burn things at the old kiln pit near the lake. Things that shouldn't be burned anywhere.

**ARJUN:** Medical waste.

**AJIT:** Maybe. I don't ask. But trucks come from Sangli direction. Hospital trucks. Sometimes with covered loads. They don't go to Gokhale kiln - too visible. They go to the old pit directly. Burn there. Cool ash in lake. Disappears by morning.

**ARJUN:** The More children saw this?

**AJIT:** (nods) Wrong place, wrong time. Playing near the lake when trucks came. Gauri was old enough to understand. She told her father. Father told wrong person. (pause) Two days later, both children at the lake. Only boy came back. And now you're here asking questions.

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

### Key Information:
- Ajit confirms talbed mining operation
- Devrao was against it, Madhav pushed ahead anyway
- Knew Nimkar would be "solved" differently
- Admits knowing but not participating in murders
- Medical waste from Sangli hospitals
- More children saw burning, told father, father told wrong person
- Old kiln pit near lake = burning site

### Clears Red Herring:
- Ajit is not killer - just complicit through silence
- Points directly to Madhav as main operator

### This Interview Unlocks:
- More family investigation (who did father tell?)
- Location of burning site for evidence
