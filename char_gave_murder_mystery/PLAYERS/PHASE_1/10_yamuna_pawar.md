## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Nirmala is working in her small kitchen. She is worn but still functioning, unlike her husband. The house is clean but bare - no photos on walls, no decorations. She doesn't stop working while talking.*

**NIRMALA:** You are Sarla's daughter. The doctor.

**LEENA:** Yes, mavshi. I'm sorry to disturb you.

**NIRMALA:** (continues grinding spices) Everyone disturbs us. For eight years. Relatives, neighbors, strangers. All wanting to talk about our dead children. As if talking brings them back.

**LEENA:** I'm trying to understand what happened.

**NIRMALA:** What happened is simple. My children died. The lake took them. Or God took them. Or someone took them. The result is same - two empty beds in my house.

**LEENA:** Harish-kaka says he believes they were murdered.

**NIRMALA:** (grinding stops briefly, resumes harder) Harish believes many things. He believes God is punishing him. He believes he should have been better father. He believes the world is against him. Belief is all he has left.

**LEENA:** What do you believe?

**NIRMALA:** (long pause) I believe my daughter's eyes were open when we found her. I believe drowned people's eyes should be closed. I believe the marks on her wrist were not from water.

**LEENA:** Marks?

**NIRMALA:** (puts down grinding stone) Small marks. Like fingers. Like someone grabbed. But the police said nothing. The doctor - the old one, before you - he said drowning marks. Mud marks. Normal. (bitter) Everything is normal when poor people die.

**LEENA:** You told the police about this?

**NIRMALA:** I tried. The constable wrote something. Nothing came of it. After a week, he said case closed. No one asked any more questions.

**LEENA:** Do you remember anything else? Anything unusual before that night?

**NIRMALA:** (thinks) They had been to the scrubland near Babhul. They liked to explore there. Old buildings, the survey office. Neelam said she found something interesting. She was going to show teacher. She was excited. (voice softens) My Neelam was always excited about learning. First in her class.

**LEENA:** Did she say what she found?

**NIRMALA:** Papers. Old papers. With names and numbers. She said it was about the kiln. And the Tal land. I told her to throw it - what do we need old papers for? But she said... she said something strange.

**LEENA:** What?

**NIRMALA:** She said "Someone did bad things, Aai. And then lied about it. And someone died because of the lies." I said don't talk nonsense. Next day... (stops, composes herself) ...next day they were gone.

**LEENA:** Someone died because of lies. Did she say who?

**NIRMALA:** No. And I didn't ask. I thought it was child fantasy. Old papers, old stories. I didn't think... (voice cracks) I should have listened. I should have paid attention. Maybe if I had taken those papers myself, hidden them...

**LEENA:** The papers are gone?

**NIRMALA:** Gone. We searched everything. Their secret places, their school bags. Nothing. Either they took them that night, or someone came and took them after.

**LEENA:** Did anyone come to the house after?

**NIRMALA:** Many people. Mourning, offering help. (pause) One person came at strange time. Late night. I thought I heard footsteps. Harish was asleep - he took pills to sleep those days. I looked but saw no one. Next morning, I noticed - their school bags were different. Moved. Someone had searched them.

**LEENA:** You didn't tell anyone?

**NIRMALA:** Who to tell? The police who closed the case? The sarpanch who tells us to forget? (looks at Leena directly) Some things I keep to myself. Some things I wait to tell the right person.
