## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**ARJUN:** The first one. The twins. Fifteen years ago.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (takes a breath) That is where it all started, sir. Ira and Asha. Twin girls. Age eight. 1988.

**ARJUN:** You were police here then?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** I was junior then. But yes. I was here. I remember that day like it was yesterday.

**ARJUN:** What happened?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** It was monsoon season. Heavy rains that year. The lake was full. The girls went out to play near the water. Their mother was... she was not well that day. She could not watch them properly. When evening came and girls did not return, everyone searched.

**ARJUN:** And?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (voice drops) Found them in the lake. Both together. Holding hands. Even in death, they did not let go of each other.

**ARJUN:** That was ruled accidental drowning?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** What else? Flash flood. Children playing near water. Tragedy. The mother... she never spoke again after that. Literally. Her voice left her.

**ARJUN:** Never spoke again? You mean she became mute?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** From grief, sir. Some people... when pain is too much, the body shuts down. She sits alone in Vasti. Has not said a word in fifteen years. Only her hands move. She makes gestures. Her neighbors understand her somehow.

**ARJUN:** The father?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (pauses oddly) Died. Accident at the kiln. Few months after the girls.

**ARJUN:** Few months? That's quick.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** Bad luck follows bad luck, sir. Some families are cursed.

**ARJUN:** Was he a kiln worker?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** Yes. Worked at Gokhale family kiln. They gave good money to his widow. Still do, I think. They are kind people, the Gokhales.

**ARJUN:** Tell me about the curse. When did that start?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** After the twins died. People started seeing things at the lake. Two small figures in white. Walking on water. Some say they heard children laughing at night. Then the Gokhale's servant - old Raghoba - he had some kind of... attack. Started screaming about seeing the girls near the lake. After that, everyone believed.

**ARJUN:** This Raghoba. Where is he now?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** Still at Wada. Still serving the zamindar family. Very old now. Seventy maybe. Quiet man. Keeps to himself.

**ARJUN:** The zamindar. Gadkari Saheb. What is his connection to this?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (careful) The zamindar is good man, sir. He was very affected by the twins' death. He paid for the funeral. Gave money to the mother. Even now, he does puja at the lake every year on the death anniversary. He believes his family's land is cursed.

**ARJUN:** Why would HIS family be cursed because of those girls?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (uncomfortable) Old families have old connections, sir. In villages, everyone is connected somehow. The girls' mother worked at Wada before she married. The zamindar felt... responsible. Like a good landowner should.
