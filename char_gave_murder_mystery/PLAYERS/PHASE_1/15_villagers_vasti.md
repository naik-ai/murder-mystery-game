## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Vasti is at the edge of the village cluster, where the lowest castes live. The houses are smaller, closer together. Leena is known here - her family is from here. Women gather around her, some holding children. Men stand at a distance, watching.*

**LEENA:** I need to ask about the lake. About the children. About the twins from fifteen years ago.

*Immediate shift in atmosphere. Some women look away.*

**OLDER WOMAN (KAVERI-BAI):** Why do you ask about them? They are dead and gone. Let them rest.

**LEENA:** Because more children died. And I think the truth about the first ones... might help us understand.

**YOUNG MOTHER (MINA):** We don't know truth. We are Vasti people. We know what they tell us. What happens in Wada, in Bhatti, in big families - that is not our business.

**LEENA:** The twins' mother, Kalyani, lives here. She was one of us.

*Silence stretches.*

**KAVERI-BAI:** (sighs) Kalyani was beautiful. Long time ago. Before grief took her. She was so beautiful that... (stops)

**LEENA:** That what?

**KAVERI-BAI:** That important people noticed. People who should not notice a girl from Vasti.

**MINA:** (whispers) The zamindar. He noticed. We all know. Everyone pretends not to know, but we know.

**LEENA:** Kalyani and the zamindar?

**KAVERI-BAI:** She worked at Wada. Young girl, washing clothes, cleaning. He was younger then. His wife was cold even then. These things happen. Sin happens. And children come from sin.

**LEENA:** The twins were...?

**MINA:** His. Everyone knew by looking at them. They had his eyes. His forehead. They looked nothing like Gopal, Kalyani's husband. Poor Gopal knew too. Everyone knew he knew. But what could he do? Fight a zamindar?

**LEENA:** So the twins were the zamindar's children?

**KAVERI-BAI:** (nods slowly) And they died. And then Gopal died. And Kalyani stopped speaking. And money came from Wada every month. Guilt money. Blood money. Whatever you call it.

**LEENA:** Who would want the twins dead? If this is true?

*Women exchange looks.*

**OLD WOMAN (RADHA-AAJI):** (who has been silent) The wife. Vasundhara. She found out about the affair late. After the twins were born. When everyone started whispering. When her husband started visiting Vasti too often.

**LEENA:** Vasundhara killed them?

**RADHA-AAJI:** (holds up hand) I did not say that. I cannot say that. She is zamindar's wife. We are Vasti people. But... (leans close) ...when the twins died, something changed at Wada. Something in the air. The way people looked at each other. Fear mixed with relief. I cannot explain it better. Some people were sad. Some people were... something else.

**LEENA:** Did you tell anyone?

**RADHA-AAJI:** I told my husband. He slapped me. Said if I spoke again, he would throw me out. Said Vasundhara would destroy our family. (bitter laugh) Destroy us? We are already nothing. But fear keeps us nothing.

**MINA:** After the twins died, many people came to offer condolences. People from Wada, from Bhatti. Some seemed sad. Some seemed... I don't know. Uncomfortable. Like they wanted to say something but couldn't.

**LEENA:** Anyone in particular?

**KAVERI-BAI:** (shrugs) We are Vasti people. Everyone from the big houses looks the same to us. Uncomfortable. Guilty, maybe. But guilty of what? Of being rich while we suffer? Of ignoring us until tragedy brings them to our doors? Who knows.

**LEENA:** Did Kalyani react to any visitor?

**KAVERI-BAI:** Kalyani didn't react to anyone. She had already stopped speaking by then. She just sat and stared. At everyone. At no one. The grief had taken her voice. What more could anyone take?

*The group goes quiet. Children's laughter from somewhere. The weight of fifteen years of silence hangs in the air.*
