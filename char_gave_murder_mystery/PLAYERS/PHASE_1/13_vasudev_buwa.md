## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Gajanan Buwa sits under the ancient banyan tree near Korde Tal. The lake is visible in the distance, shrouded in evening mist. He is ash-covered, with matted hair, but his eyes are startlingly clear. He speaks in riddles, mixing Hindi and Marathi with Sanskrit verses.*

**LEENA:** Buwa-ji, I need to ask you about the lake. About the children who died.

**GAJANAN BUWA:** (doesn't look at her, stares at lake) The one who asks also knows. The one who knows is afraid to say. Why ask an old fool when the truth walks among you?

**LEENA:** I don't understand.

**GAJANAN BUWA:** (chuckles) Good. Understanding is dangerous. See what understanding did to those little ones? They understood too much. Now they swim with the fish.

**LEENA:** You knew the children who died?

**GAJANAN BUWA:** I know all children. I know all sinners. I know the ones who pray for forgiveness at dawn and cannot sleep at night. The sins of the fathers fall upon the children. The sins of the powerful crush the weak. (stares into distance) Many hands. Many motives. The same lake receives all secrets.

**LEENA:** (carefully) Who are these people you're describing?

**GAJANAN BUWA:** (finally looks at her) You want names? Names are cages. The truth is bigger than names. But since you ask - look to where fire burns without light. Look to where water holds secrets. Look to where the great house hides its shame behind charity.

**LEENA:** The kiln? The lake? Wada?

**GAJANAN BUWA:** (smiles mysteriously) The wise one speaks. See? You don't need old Gajanan. You already know. You are afraid to know that you know.

**LEENA:** The children who died. What can you tell me about them?

**GAJANAN BUWA:** (becomes serious, rocks back and forth) Three deaths. Three patterns. (mumbles incoherently) The lake remembers all sins. The water keeps what the land rejects. The mud holds what the air cannot carry. (laughs mysteriously) The mad see many things. Most are shadows. Some are flesh. Who can tell which is which?

**LEENA:** What do you mean by patterns?

**GAJANAN BUWA:** (ignores question, stares at water) The first pair - those tiny girls - they were special. Everyone knows. No one says. (taps his chest) Some deaths have roots in the heart. Some in the pocket. (shrugs mysteriously) Ask the water. Ask the walls of the big house. Ask why charity flows to the silent mother.

**LEENA:** And the others?

**GAJANAN BUWA:** The others saw. They knew. They asked. (makes drowning gesture) In this village, seeing is dangerous. Knowing is fatal. Asking... (draws finger across throat) ...asking is suicide.

**LEENA:** Who should I talk to? Who knows the truth?

**GAJANAN BUWA:** (laughs wildly) Everyone! Everyone knows! The mother who lost her voice. The servant who screams names in his sleep. The worker who carries food but also carries fear. The one who watches the lake at night and tells himself he sees ghosts. Everyone knows. No one speaks. This is the curse - not ghosts, not spirits - just silence. The village is cursed with silence.

**LEENA:** Will you tell me directly? No riddles?

**GAJANAN BUWA:** (suddenly serious, grabs her hand) Sarla's daughter. Your mother knows about the twins. Ask her. (releases hand, returns to mad saint mode) Now go. The lake is listening. The trees have ears. The dead children watch from the water. Go and find what you already know.
