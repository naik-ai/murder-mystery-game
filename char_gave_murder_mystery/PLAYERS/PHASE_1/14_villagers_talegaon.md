## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Evening in the village square. Men sit on the panchayat steps, smoking bidis. Women gather water from the pump. Children play at a distance. Arjun approaches the group. Conversation stops.*

**ARJUN:** I am from CID Pune. I want to understand what people believe about the children who died.

*Silence. People exchange glances.*

**OLD MAN (KAKA BHOSLE):** What is there to believe? The curse is real. We have all seen.

**ARJUN:** What have you seen?

**MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (TAI):** I have seen the girls. The twin ghosts. Walking near the lake at full moon. White dresses. No feet. They float.

**YOUNG MAN (SANTOSH):** My father saw them too. Before he died. He said they called his name. He got fever next day. Dead within the month.

**ARJUN:** When did your father see them?

**SANTOSH:** Three years ago. Full moon night. He was coming from the kiln side. Working late. Saw two figures near the water. He ran home. Never went that way again.

**ARJUN:** (to the group) Has anyone seen these ghosts up close?

*Uncomfortable silence.*

**ELDERLY WOMAN (AAJI):** No one goes close. If you see them, you run. That is how you survive.

**ARJUN:** Has anyone NOT run? Anyone who got a good look?

**OLD MAN BHOSLE:** (hesitant) Dinesh. The watchman at kiln. He sees them most. He works at night. He says they come to the lake often. Not just full moon. Many nights. Sometimes with lights. Sometimes with... sounds.

**ARJUN:** What kind of sounds?

**OLD MAN BHOSLE:** (shrugs) Engine. Truck engine. The ghosts have modern transportation now. (others laugh nervously)

**ARJUN:** Truck engines? At the lake at night?

**TAI:** (quickly) He is joking. Old man makes jokes. There are no trucks at the lake. Just ghosts. The engine sounds are... maybe wind. Maybe imagination.

**ARJUN:** (notices the deflection) Has anyone actually been harmed by these ghosts? Other than the children?

**YOUNG MAN SANTOSH:** We don't go near. We stay away. The children... they don't listen. They explore. They wander. That is why the curse takes them.

**ELDERLY WOMAN AAJI:** The curse is patient. It waits for the curious ones. The ones who ask too many questions.

**ARJUN:** Is that a warning?

**AAJI:** (looks directly at him) Take it as you wish, saheb. Some questions are better not asked. Some answers are better not known.

*A woman approaches from behind. She has been listening.*

**KASHIBAI:** (younger woman, angry) Enough ghost stories. I will tell you truth. There are no ghosts. There are men. I have seen them. At the lake. At night. Two men with cloth on faces. Doing something. I told my husband. He told me to forget. He said I will get us killed if I talk.

**TAI:** Kashibai! Quiet!

**KASHIBAI:** No! I am tired of quiet! Four months ago, a girl died. My daughter's friend. And everyone talks about ghosts like they don't know. (points at the men) You know! You all know! But you are scared. (starts crying) We are all scared and children are dying.

*Her husband rushes forward, pulls her away.*

**KASHIBAI'S HUSBAND:** She is emotional. She doesn't know what she's saying. Please forgive her. The grief has affected her mind.

*The crowd disperses quickly. No one else will talk.*
