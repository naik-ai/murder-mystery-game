## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**ARJUN:** The Karande children. Eight years ago. Tell me about that case.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (pulls out older, thinner file) Neelam Karande, age fourteen. Omkar Karande, age twelve. March 1995.

**ARJUN:** What happened?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** Same as the others, sir. They went to the lake at night. Did not return. Bodies found next morning. Drowned.

**ARJUN:** Both of them? A fourteen-year-old and twelve-year-old drowned together?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** The curse, sir. I told you. Once the twins died, the lake became... hungry.

**ARJUN:** Your file says suicide.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** What else to write? No marks. No struggle. No witness. Just two children floating in the water. The parents said they were good children. Happy. No reason to die. But they died anyway.

**ARJUN:** You didn't find that strange? Happy children with no problems suddenly decide to drown themselves?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (uncomfortable pause) Sir, I am village police. I write what I see. I cannot write what I feel.

**ARJUN:** What did you feel?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (lowers voice) Those children were not ordinary. Before they died, they were asking questions. Strange questions. About trucks. About the talbed. About papers they found somewhere.

**ARJUN:** What kind of papers?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** I don't know, sir. The teacher mentioned it. Said the children were very excited about some old papers. Then... then they died. I thought maybe the papers made them go somewhere dangerous. The scrubland is not safe at night.

**ARJUN:** Did anyone look for these papers?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (long pause) No. The parents were broken. The village was afraid. Everyone just wanted to forget. The papers... no one asked about papers after that.

**ARJUN:** The father, Harish Karande. Is he still in the village?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** Yes. He became very religious after. Stopped working. Sits at temple all day. His mind is half gone, they say. His wife takes care of everything now.

**ARJUN:** I want to speak to him.

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** You can try, sir. But he doesn't talk much anymore. Says the gods took his children as punishment. He believes he did something wrong.

**ARJUN:** Did he?

**CONSTABLE GHADGE:** (shifts eyes) Who am I to say, sir. Every man has sins. Whether his sins killed his children... that is for gods to know.
