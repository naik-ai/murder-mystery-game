## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Haribhau is the oldest servant in the Wada. He sits by the clay stove, stirring dal with a wooden ladle. The kitchen smells of turmeric and woodsmoke. He speaks slowly, choosing words carefully.*

**ARJUN:** Thirty-five years in this Wada, I'm told.

**HARIBHAU:** Thirty-seven. I came when old Gadkari Saheb was alive. Before the son married. Before this Vasundhara came into the house.

**ARJUN:** You've seen many things then.

**HARIBHAU:** (stirs slowly) Kitchen sees everything. Food goes to every room. Cook sees who eats, who doesn't. Who is happy, who is sick. Who whispers in corners.

**ARJUN:** What have you seen that others haven't?

**HARIBHAU:** (long pause) I am old. I want to finish my life in peace. Why are you asking these questions?

**ARJUN:** Because children have been dying for fifteen years and no one has stopped it.

**HARIBHAU:** (ladle stops) Dying. Yes. Dying by that cursed lake. Every few years, more small bodies. (shakes head) When I was young, that lake was just water. We swam there. Fished there. Nothing happened.

**ARJUN:** So what changed?

**HARIBHAU:** The Wada changed. After old Saheb died. The new Saheb married Vasundhara. She came from Kolhapur. Big family, much land, much pride. Too much pride for this small village.

**ARJUN:** What does the lady of the house have to do with children drowning?

**HARIBHAU:** (careful) I didn't say she has anything to do with it. I said things changed after she came. The feeling of this house changed. It became... colder. More calculating. Even the walls learned to be silent.

**ARJUN:** Tell me about Kalyani. The mother of the twins who died first.

**HARIBHAU:** (stirs again, eyes on pot) She used to work here. Before her children died. Kitchen help. Young. Beautiful. Too beautiful maybe.

**ARJUN:** Too beautiful for what?

**HARIBHAU:** Too beautiful for her own safety. This is village, saheb. A beautiful low-caste woman in a big house full of men... you understand what I am saying.

**ARJUN:** Are you saying something happened between Kalyani and someone in this house?

**HARIBHAU:** I am saying what my eyes saw. Which was nothing. But what my ears heard... that is different.

**ARJUN:** What did your ears hear?

**HARIBHAU:** Crying. From Bai's room. Night before that puja happened. The night before the twins died. Vasundhara-bai was crying. Shouting. I couldn't hear words but I heard rage. I never heard her cry before or after. She is stone, that woman. But that night... something broke her stone.

**ARJUN:** And Raghoba? Where was he that night?

**HARIBHAU:** (stops stirring entirely) Raghoba was... not in his room. I went to give him food - he had skipped dinner - and his room was empty. Cot was cold.

**ARJUN:** What time was this?

**HARIBHAU:** Late. After everyone slept. Maybe eleven, twelve at night.

**ARJUN:** The twins were last seen around eight in the evening.

**HARIBHAU:** (meets Arjun's eyes) I know.

**ARJUN:** You never said anything?

**HARIBHAU:** Said what? To whom? That Raghoba's bed was empty? This is not crime. Man can walk at night. Man can have reasons. (pause) I had no proof. I had no words. I just had... feeling. And feelings are not evidence.

**ARJUN:** What was your feeling?

**HARIBHAU:** (very quiet) That this house killed those children. Not the lake. Not the curse. This house. And if I said anything, this house would kill me too.
