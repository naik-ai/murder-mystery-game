## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Dinesh is a wiry man with bloodshot eyes - the result of years of night shifts. He carries a lathi and keeps glancing toward the kiln office where Madhav Gokhale works.*

**ARJUN:** You've been the night watchman here for how long?

**DINESH:** Eleven years, saheb. Since my father died. He had this job before me.

**ARJUN:** So you work nights. What exactly do you watch?

**DINESH:** The kilns. The stock. The trucks. Making sure no one steals bricks. Making sure fires don't spread.

**ARJUN:** And the lake? The path goes past here to reach Korde Tal.

**DINESH:** (nervous glance) Yes. Lake is that side. Maybe half kilometer.

**ARJUN:** Do you ever see anything at night? Near the lake?

**DINESH:** (swallows) Ghosts, saheb. Everyone knows. The twin girls. They walk at night. I have seen them myself.

**ARJUN:** Describe what you saw.

**DINESH:** White shapes. Moving. Sometimes near the water, sometimes on the path. Making no sound. Just... floating. The way ghosts float.

**ARJUN:** How far away were you when you saw this?

**DINESH:** Maybe hundred meters. I don't go close. Why would I go close? To die?

**ARJUN:** Did these ghosts ever carry anything? Wear specific clothing?

**DINESH:** (confused) Carry? Ghosts don't carry things.

**ARJUN:** But you saw them clearly enough to say they were twin girls. From hundred meters. At night.

**DINESH:** (hesitates) Everyone knows the story. When you see white shapes at the lake, you know what they are.

**ARJUN:** What about trucks? Do trucks pass here at night?

**DINESH:** Sometimes. Brick orders don't follow clock. When customer wants, truck goes.

**ARJUN:** And trucks going toward the lake specifically?

**DINESH:** (long pause, shifts weight) Some trucks... they don't carry bricks. They carry... other things. I don't ask what. Madhav-saheb told me - what goes in those trucks is not your business. Just watch the kilns. So I watch the kilns.

**ARJUN:** How often do these "other" trucks come?

**DINESH:** Maybe twice in month. Maybe more. I don't count. I don't watch.

**ARJUN:** The smell. What about the smell?

**DINESH:** Which smell? Kilns smell. Burning coal smells. Everything smells here.

**ARJUN:** The smell from the lake direction. On nights when those trucks come.

**DINESH:** (face tightens) Burning plastic. Burning... I don't know what. Bad smell. Makes eyes water. Makes throat hurt. But it comes with wind. When wind changes, it goes.

**ARJUN:** And you never investigated?

**DINESH:** I am paid to watch kilns. I watch kilns. What happens at lake is lake's business. Ghosts' business. Not Dinesh's business.

**ARJUN:** The night the More children disappeared. Four months ago. Where were you?

**DINESH:** (stands very still) Here. At kilns. Watching.

**ARJUN:** Did you see anything? Anyone?

**DINESH:** (quietly) I saw ghosts. Two small white shapes near the water. And then... one shape less. And then later... no shapes. Just darkness.

**ARJUN:** You saw the children disappear and you did nothing?

**DINESH:** I saw GHOSTS disappear. What can man do against ghosts? Nothing. So I did nothing. I went back to watching kilns. That is my job.
