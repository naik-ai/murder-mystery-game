## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Kisan is chopping vegetables for the evening meal. He's a quiet young man, thin, with watchful eyes. He keeps glancing toward the main house as he talks.*

**LEENA:** You're Raghoba's nephew?

**KISAN:** Sister's son. He got me this work when I was sixteen. Eight years now.

**LEENA:** You live in the servants' quarters with him?

**KISAN:** Yes. Same room. Separate cots. He snores. (small smile that fades quickly)

**LEENA:** I wanted to ask about your uncle. About his... health. His state of mind.

**KISAN:** (knife pauses) Why? Is he in trouble?

**LEENA:** No. I'm a doctor. I notice things. He seemed tense when I saw him earlier.

**KISAN:** Kaka is always tense. Has been for years. Long as I can remember.

**LEENA:** Years? Since when exactly?

**KISAN:** (thinks) Since before I came here. My mother says he used to be different. Laughing, singing. Now he just works and prays. Works and prays. That's all.

**LEENA:** He prays a lot?

**KISAN:** Every morning, every evening. Sometimes in the middle of the night too. I wake up and he's sitting on his cot, doing japa with his beads. Mumbling names of gods.

**LEENA:** That's unusual for him?

**KISAN:** My mother says he never used to pray. Said gods are for rich people who have time. Now... now he acts like gods are the only thing between him and... (trails off)

**LEENA:** And what?

**KISAN:** I don't know. Something. He has bad dreams sometimes. Shouts in his sleep. Names I don't know.

**LEENA:** What names?

**KISAN:** Once he said "Ira" and "Asha." Over and over. Who are they?

**LEENA:** (carefully) Those were the twin girls. The ones who drowned fifteen years ago.

**KISAN:** (eyes widen) The ghost children? He dreams about ghost children? (makes sign to ward off evil)

**LEENA:** He found their bodies. Maybe that's why.

**KISAN:** Maybe. But... (lowers voice, stops chopping) ...there's something else. He won't let me go near the lake. Ever. If I even mention it, he gets angry. Once I said I wanted to swim there - I was new, I didn't know the stories - and he grabbed me so hard he left marks. Said if I ever went there, he would break my legs himself.

**LEENA:** Strong reaction.

**KISAN:** Too strong. I thought at first he was protecting me from ghosts. But now I wonder...

**LEENA:** Wonder what?

**KISAN:** (voice barely audible) What if he's protecting ghosts from me? What if he doesn't want me to find something there?

**LEENA:** That's an interesting thought.

**KISAN:** (resumes chopping quickly) It's a stupid thought. Forget I said it. Kaka is good man. Takes care of family. He just has... weight on him. Weight of the Wada. This place has weight.

**LEENA:** Does he spend time with Vasundhara-bai?

**KISAN:** He attends her. Takes orders from her. She trusts him more than anyone. More than her own son who left for Bombay. More than Gadkari Saheb even.

**LEENA:** She trusts a servant that much?

**KISAN:** He has been with her for forty years. He knows things. (pause) She has told him things. Things she cannot tell anyone else. That is what he says when he is... (stops himself)

**LEENA:** When he is what?

**KISAN:** (shakes head) I should not say. He drinks sometimes. Late night. Then he talks. Talks about burden. About debt that cannot be paid. About how some things cannot be undone.

**LEENA:** Debts to whom?

**KISAN:** To Bai. To this Wada. He says he sold something long ago. Something he cannot buy back. Then he cries. I pretend to sleep. It is not my place to see a man like him cry.
