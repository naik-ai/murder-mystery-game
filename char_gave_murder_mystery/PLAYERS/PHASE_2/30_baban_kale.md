## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Sanjay is half-drunk when Leena finds him. The country liquor shop is a shed with three wooden benches. He sits alone, staring at his glass. He's unkempt, eyes hollow.*

**LEENA:** Sanjay? I'm Doctor Leena. Can I sit?

**SANJAY:** (gestures vaguely) Free country. Sit anywhere.

**LEENA:** I want to ask about your father. Raghav Nimkar.

**SANJAY:** (laughs hollow) Father. Survey-wala. Snake-killed man. What about him?

**LEENA:** He died eleven years ago. Snakebite.

**SANJAY:** That's what they say. Snakebite. Very convenient, snakebite. No investigation needed. Man goes to the talbed, snake bites, man dies. Simple story. (drinks)

**LEENA:** You don't believe it was snakebite?

**SANJAY:** I was seventeen. In school in Satara. Got message - come home, your father is dead. I came. They had already cremated him. Already burned. No body to see. Just ashes. And my mother crying. And people saying how sad, how terrible, the scrubland is so dangerous.

**LEENA:** Did your mother believe it?

**SANJAY:** (face darkens) Mother believed nothing. She asked questions. Too many questions. Asked why father was in that part of the talbed. Asked why doctor didn't check him properly. Asked why revenue officer was so quick to close file.

**ARJUN:** What happened to her questions?

**SANJAY:** First they ignored her. Then they threatened her. Said she was creating trouble, disturbing peace. Said if she kept asking, we would lose the house. Father's job was gone - she had no income. I was in school. She had no choice.

**LEENA:** She stopped asking?

**SANJAY:** She stopped talking. Period. For months she didn't speak. Just sat. Just stared. Then one morning... (drinks heavily) ...one morning I woke up and she was gone. They found her in the well three days later.

**LEENA:** Oh god. I'm sorry.

**SANJAY:** Everyone said suicide. Just like children in lake. Everyone in this area dies of suicide apparently. Very sad people we are. Very fond of dying.

**LEENA:** You think she was killed too?

**SANJAY:** I think she found something. Those questions she asked? They weren't random. Father had papers. She found them after he died. Old papers. Survey documents. Something about land. She hid them. Wouldn't show me. Said I was too young, too hot-headed, I would do something stupid.

**LEENA:** Do you know where those papers are now?

**SANJAY:** (shakes head) After she died, I searched everywhere. Nothing. Either she destroyed them or someone took them. House was empty for three days after she disappeared. Anyone could have come.

**LEENA:** What was your father working on before he died?

**SANJAY:** Some survey. Talbed boundary verification. He was excited about it. Said he found discrepancies. Land that should be protected was being used. He was going to file report. Make formal complaint. Said it would make big names uncomfortable. (laughs bitter) It made him dead instead.

**LEENA:** Did he mention any names? Who was using the protected land?

**SANJAY:** Never said directly. But week before he died, he had argument with someone at the kiln. I wasn't there but neighbor told me. Shouting. Father saying "this is government land" and other man saying "stay out of what you don't understand."

**LEENA:** Which kiln? Which man?

**SANJAY:** The big one. Gokhale kiln. And the man... (thinks, drinks) ...the younger brother. Not the one who runs it now. The other one. Madhav.

**LEENA:** Madhav Gokhale argued with your father about protected land. Week before your father died.

**SANJAY:** (meets her eyes, surprisingly clear) Now you understand why I drink. I have known for eleven years who killed my father. I have known for eleven years who drove my mother to death. And I can do nothing. Because I have no proof. Because I am drunk son of dead clerk. Who will believe me?

**LEENA:** Do you know what happened to the Karande children? Eight years ago?

**SANJAY:** Those two? The curious ones? (nods) They came to me once. Asking about my father. Asking about his work. Asking about papers they found somewhere. I told them to leave it alone. Said look what happened to people who ask questions. They didn't listen.

**LEENA:** They found your father's report?

**SANJAY:** Maybe. They wouldn't show me. But they knew things. Names. Places. (voice drops) I told them to be careful. Told them this village swallows people who know too much. Two weeks later... (finishes drink) ...lake swallowed them too.
