## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Rukmini sits on a cot outside her small house, sorting dried chilies. Her hands are rough and cracked from decades of kiln work. She doesn't look up when Leena approaches.*

**LEENA:** Rukmini mavshi, may I speak with you?

**RUKMINI:** (continues sorting) Speak. My ears still work even if my eyes are failing.

**LEENA:** I'm asking about the children who died at the lake.

**RUKMINI:** (hands pause briefly) Which ones? Many children have died. This place eats children like the kilns eat coal.

**LEENA:** Any of them. All of them. What do you remember?

**RUKMINI:** I remember working. Always working. From before sun up until after sun down. Brick by brick. Year by year. That is what I remember.

**LEENA:** But you lived near the lake for many years. You must have seen things.

**RUKMINI:** (shifts uncomfortable) I saw bricks. I saw fire. I saw my husband grow old and die. I saw my sons leave for city work. What else is there to see?

**LEENA:** Trucks maybe? At night?

**RUKMINI:** (hands shake slightly) Trucks come and go. This is brick business. Trucks are normal.

**LEENA:** Trucks going toward the lake? Not the highway?

**RUKMINI:** (long pause) Sometimes trucks get lost. Bad roads. Dark nights. Who can say where trucks go in the dark?

**LEENA:** Mavshi, I'm not here to make trouble for anyone. I just want to understand what happened to those children.

**RUKMINI:** (finally looks up) You want to understand? Then understand this - some things should not be understood. Some questions should not be asked. Those children... all of them... they asked questions. They saw things. They talked. And now they are silent forever.

**LEENA:** What did they see? What did they talk about?

**RUKMINI:** (shakes head) I am old. I am scared. I have buried one husband and I want to die in my bed, not floating in that cursed water. Ask someone younger. Ask someone braver.

**LEENA:** Madhav Gokhale? Should I ask him?

**RUKMINI:** (face goes white) Don't say that name here. Don't say it anywhere. (grabs Leena's wrist with surprising strength) His ears are everywhere. His eyes too. Even the bricks have ears when he is angry.

**LEENA:** You're afraid of him specifically. Why?

**RUKMINI:** (releases grip, returns to sorting) I said nothing. You heard nothing. Now go. I have work.

**LEENA:** One more question. The smell at the lake - people say it's different now. Chemical smell. Burning smell.

**RUKMINI:** (stops sorting entirely) That is not a question.

**LEENA:** No. But you know what it is, don't you?

**RUKMINI:** (very quietly) My son works at district hospital in Sangli. Three years ago, he asked if I know any "disposal" people. For waste. Medical waste. Things that cannot go in regular garbage. I said no. I said I don't know such people. (pause) I lied. I knew. But I said nothing. Because I wanted my son to stay in his clean hospital job and never come back to this place.

**LEENA:** Medical waste is being burned at the lake?

**RUKMINI:** I said nothing. I heard nothing. You should do the same if you want to keep breathing. Now go. The chilies won't sort themselves.
