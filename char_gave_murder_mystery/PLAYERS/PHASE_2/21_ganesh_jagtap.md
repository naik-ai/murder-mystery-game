## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Nilesh's kiln is smaller than the Patil operation. He sits outside his shed, nervous. He is a slight man, always looking over his shoulder. His father died three years ago; he's been running the kiln since.*

**LEENA:** Nilesh-bhai, I need to ask about your father.

**NILESH:** (startles) My father? He's dead. Three years now. What about him?

**LEENA:** I've heard he made regular payments to certain families. After the children died.

**NILESH:** (face pales) Who told you that?

**LEENA:** Does it matter? Is it true?

**NILESH:** (long silence, then) Yes. He gave money. I still give money. I don't know why.

**LEENA:** You don't know why you're paying people?

**NILESH:** (stands, agitated) He told me - before he died - he said "Nilesh, every month, send money to these families." He gave me names. Amounts. He said it was charity. Good karma. But... (trails off)

**LEENA:** But?

**NILESH:** (sits back down) The families he named. They are all... connected. To the deaths. Karande family gets money. More family gets money. Before that, a woman in Vasti - Kalyani - she got money for years from Wada, but my father also sent her small amounts.

**LEENA:** Your father was paying families of dead children?

**NILESH:** I think so. Yes. I didn't ask him why. He was dying. Cancer. I thought maybe he was guilty about something. Maybe he thought charity would help his soul.

**LEENA:** Did you ask anyone else? Madhav Gokhale? Devrao Gokhale?

**NILESH:** (whispers) Once. I asked Madhav-saheb why my father started this. He laughed. Said my father was soft-hearted. Said some people feel guilty even when they're not responsible. He told me to continue if it made me feel better.

**LEENA:** That didn't seem strange to you?

**NILESH:** Everything seems strange. But I am small kiln. Madhav-saheb is big. I don't ask questions. (looks directly at her) My father... he changed after the Karande children died. Eight years ago. He was never the same. He stopped sleeping well. He would wake up crying sometimes. He never explained.

**LEENA:** Did he know something about those deaths?

**NILESH:** (in anguish) I don't know. I was afraid to ask. What if my father... what if he was involved in something? He's dead now. What good does it do to dig up his sins?

**LEENA:** Were there specific amounts? Same every month?

**NILESH:** Different for each family. Postmaster Ramesh Bhat handles it. He's been doing it since my father's time. He doesn't ask questions either. Just sends the money orders.

**LEENA:** What about the kiln network? The talbed encroachment operation?

**NILESH:** (genuinely confused) Talbed? We make bricks. The Gokhale kiln handles the big contracts. We handle local orders. I don't know about talbed papers.

**LEENA:** You've never seen trucks at night going to the lake?

**NILESH:** (shakes head) I go home at sunset. I don't stay at the kiln at night. Dinesh watches - he's the night man. But I don't ask him what he sees. I don't want to know. (pleading) I just want to run a small kiln, pay my workers, take care of my family. Whatever my father did, whatever the Gokhales do - I'm not part of it. Please believe me.
