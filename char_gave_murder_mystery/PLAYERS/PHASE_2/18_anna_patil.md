## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*The Patil home is the largest in the kiln area. Comfortable but not ostentatious. Devrao Gokhale sits on a wooden chair, gracious but cautious. He has the bearing of a man used to respect.*

**DEVRAO PATIL:** CID officer. Please, sit. My wife will bring chai.

**ARJUN:** Thank you. I want to ask about the kiln operations.

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (relaxes slightly) The kiln? Of course. Family business. Four generations now. We make bricks. Supply all the villages in the area. Nothing special, but honest work.

**ARJUN:** How many people work at the kiln?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** Fifty, sixty. Depends on season. Monsoon is slow. Summer is busy. We take care of our workers. Ask anyone - Gokhale kiln is a good place to work.

**ARJUN:** Your brother Madhav runs the day-to-day operations?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (slight hesitation) Yes. Madhav handles the operations. I handle the business side. Accounts, supplies, customers. Division of labor.

**ARJUN:** Madhav returned from the city about ten years ago?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** Yes. He was in Mumbai. Business didn't work out. He came home. Family is family. I gave him responsibility at the kiln.

**ARJUN:** What kind of business in Mumbai?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (waves hand) This and that. He doesn't talk about it. City life didn't suit him, he said. Came home with some money, some ideas. The kiln has grown since he took over operations. More customers, more efficiency.

**ARJUN:** What about waste disposal? Where does the ash go?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** Ash? We have a designated area. Rakhe site. East of here. Government approved. We follow all rules.

**ARJUN:** Do trucks go to the lake at night?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (frowns) Lake? No. Why would we take ash to the lake? That's in the opposite direction. Who told you this?

**ARJUN:** I've heard rumors. Night trucks. Lake burning.

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (shakes head firmly) Rumors. This village runs on rumors. There is no night disposal at lake. If anyone is going there at night, it is not for kiln business.

**ARJUN:** Could your brother be doing something without your knowledge?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (uncomfortable pause) Madhav is... Madhav. He has his own ways. But he is not stupid. Illegal burning would destroy our reputation. Destroy the business. He knows this.

**ARJUN:** What about the talbed connection? I've heard the kiln uses encroached land and trucks at night.

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (stands up, agitated) Who is saying these things? We buy from licensed suppliers. We have papers. Receipts. Everything is documented.

**ARJUN:** Then you won't mind showing me those documents?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (calms himself) Of course. I will have them ready for you. Give me a day. All records are in order.

**ARJUN:** One more question. The children who died. Did any of them have contact with the kiln? With your family?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (sits back down) The curse victims? No. Why would they? We are brick makers, not... (stops)

**ARJUN:** Not what?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** Nothing. I was going to say we are not connected to that tragedy. We gave donations after each death. We are community people. But we were not involved. How could we be?

**ARJUN:** The More girl, Gauri. Her father sometimes worked at the kiln.

**DEVRAO PATIL:** Raghunath? Yes. Casual labor. Many people work here casually. That doesn't mean anything.

**ARJUN:** Did Gauri ever come to the kiln?

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (thinks) Maybe. Children come sometimes. To see their fathers. We don't encourage it - kilns are dangerous places. But yes, children wander through.

**ARJUN:** Gauri specifically. In the weeks before she died.

**DEVRAO PATIL:** (carefully) I don't remember. I don't track every child who passes through. Ask the workers. Ask Madhav. He knows the operations better.
