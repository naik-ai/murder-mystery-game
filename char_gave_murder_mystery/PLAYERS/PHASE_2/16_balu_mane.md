## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

**LEENA:** (kneeling to his level) Aarav? Do you remember me? I am the doctor from the davakhana.

**AARAV:** (small nod, doesn't speak)

**LEENA:** Your father said you like drawing. Is that true?

**AARAV:** (another small nod)

**LEENA:** I brought paper. And pencils. If you want.

**AARAV:** (reaches for them slowly, holds them)

**LEENA:** Aarav, I know you are scared. I am scared too sometimes. But I want to help. Can you tell me what happened that night?

**AARAV:** (long silence, then whispers) They came.

**LEENA:** Who came?

**AARAV:** The twins. The two girls from the lake. They came for us.

**LEENA:** What did they look like?

**AARAV:** (shaking slightly) Big. Not like girls. Big like... like shadows. They had no face. Just... dark.

**LEENA:** Big? How big?

**AARAV:** (gestures above his head, indicating adult height) Taller than Baba. One was very tall. One was little shorter. But both big. Not like children.

**LEENA:** You said they had no face. What do you mean?

**AARAV:** Covered. Something covered. Like... (thinks) ...like gamcha. Cloth over face. I couldn't see eyes.

**LEENA:** Did they say anything?

**AARAV:** No words. Just... (makes heavy breathing sound) ...like this. Breathing. Heavy. Like they were tired from running.

**LEENA:** They were running?

**AARAV:** No. After. When I ran. I heard them behind me. Running. But not fast. Like... like they wanted me to run. Like they let me go.

**LEENA:** Aarav, think very carefully. Did you see anything else? Anything about them? Clothes? Hands? Anything?

**AARAV:** (screws up face, concentrating) Smell. Bad smell. Like... (sniffs) ...burning plastic. Like hospital cleaning smell.

**LEENA:** The disinfectant smell?

**AARAV:** (nods vigorously) Yes! Gauri said it too. Before they came. She said "Aarav, it smells like a clinic." Then... then they came.

**LEENA:** Your sister smelled it before you saw them?

**AARAV:** Yes. She held my hand tight. She was scared. She said we should run. But then they were there. In front of us.

**LEENA:** Aarav, why did you and Gauri go to the lake that night?

**AARAV:** (looks down) We saw something. From our house. Near the lake. Lights. Moving lights. Gauri wanted to see what it was.

**LEENA:** Lights?

**AARAV:** Like torch. But on ground. Moving. We thought... Gauri thought maybe it was her friend playing game. So we went to see.

**LEENA:** And what did you find?

**AARAV:** (starts trembling) Not friends. Something else. Big thing with lights. Making noise. And then... then the shadows saw us. They came at us. I ran. Gauri... (starts crying) ...Gauri fell. She fell and they got her. I kept running. I didn't help her. I left her.

**LEENA:** (holds his hand) You were brave to run. You survived. That is not your fault.

**AARAV:** (through tears) The twins took her. Because I didn't help. Because I ran.

**LEENA:** Aarav, what was the big thing with lights? The thing making noise?

**AARAV:** (still crying) I don't know. Like truck maybe. But by the lake. Why truck at night by lake?
