## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Dr. Pande's clinic in Satara is busy. He's a careful man with tired eyes. When Leena introduces herself, he goes pale. He takes her to a private room, closes the door.*

**DR. PANDE:** The new PHC doctor. I heard they finally sent someone. After five years of the position being empty. (pause) I wondered when someone would come asking.

**LEENA:** You left suddenly. In the middle of your posting.

**DR. PANDE:** I left to stay alive. That's the honest truth. After what I saw, after what I was asked to do, staying would have meant either becoming complicit or becoming a victim.

**LEENA:** What did you see?

**DR. PANDE:** (sits heavily) The children. The ones who drowned. I examined two of them. The Karande children, eight years ago. I was new then. Idealistic. I did a proper examination even though I was told just to sign the death certificate.

**LEENA:** What did you find?

**DR. PANDE:** Things that don't match drowning. The girl - Neelam - had bruising on her upper arms. Finger marks. Someone held her down. The boy had abrasions on his palms. Like he tried to climb out of something. Defensive marks on his forearms.

**LEENA:** This wasn't in the official report.

**DR. PANDE:** (bitter laugh) I wrote my findings. Submitted them to constable. Next morning, my report was gone. Replaced with a simpler one. "Death by drowning, no signs of violence, consistent with suicide." My signature was forged.

**LEENA:** You didn't protest?

**DR. PANDE:** I tried. I went to the Sub-Inspector. He took me aside. Said I was young and didn't understand how things work. Said if I made trouble, I would be transferred somewhere unpleasant. Or worse. He mentioned a doctor in the next district who had "fallen" from a building. Heart attack, they said. While falling.

**LEENA:** So you stayed silent.

**DR. PANDE:** For three more years. I stayed silent and I watched. The village was strange. At night, trucks would pass toward the lake. Smoke would rise. Villagers would complain of headaches, eye problems, breathing issues. But no one would tell me what they saw.

**LEENA:** The waste burning?

**DR. PANDE:** I didn't know what it was then. I thought maybe agricultural burning. Crop waste. But the symptoms didn't match. I started keeping notes. Dates when trucks came. Dates when patients came with chemical exposure symptoms. The correlation was... disturbing.

**LEENA:** Do you still have these notes?

**DR. PANDE:** (hesitates, then opens drawer, pulls out old notebook) I kept copies. For years I told myself I would send them somewhere. Some newspaper. Some authority. But I never did. Fear keeps you paralyzed.

**LEENA:** (takes notebook) This is... this is extensive.

**DR. PANDE:** Three years of observations. Truck movements. Patient symptoms. Strange deaths that were ruled natural. (points to entry) Here - an old man who died of "respiratory failure." He had been healthy for years. Three days before, he told his daughter he saw men burning something at the lake. Mentioned it to people. Then - respiratory failure.

**LEENA:** You think he was killed?

**DR. PANDE:** I think many people were killed who were officially not murdered. The children are just the most obvious cases. But how many old people "died in sleep"? How many accidents? How many heart attacks?

**LEENA:** When did you finally leave?

**DR. PANDE:** When they came for me. Not to kill - just to warn. Two men at night. They didn't identify themselves but I recognized one. Worked at the kiln. They said I should stop keeping notes. Said I should sign whatever papers came to me without asking questions. Said if I didn't, my wife and children would have accidents.

**LEENA:** What did you do?

**DR. PANDE:** I applied for transfer. It was approved suspiciously fast. Within two weeks I was in Satara. The posting in your village stayed empty for five years. No one wanted it. No one wanted to be the doctor who asks questions in a place where questions mean death.

**LEENA:** You're telling me now. Why?

**DR. PANDE:** Because you came looking. Because you're young like I was. And because... (pulls out newspaper clipping) ...I saw this. The More children. Four months ago. Another drowning. Another suicide ruling. And I knew - I knew it hadn't stopped. It was still happening. And I had done nothing.

**LEENA:** The notebook. The observations. Can I take these?

**DR. PANDE:** (pushes them toward her) Take everything. Make copies. Send them wherever you need to send them. I should have done this years ago. Maybe those More children would still be alive if I had. But I was afraid. I'm still afraid. But I'm more tired of being afraid than I am of the consequences.
