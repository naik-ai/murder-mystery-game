## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Harish has been expecting Arjun. He's brought a cloth bundle with him. His eyes are clearer than before - still haunted, but with a flicker of hope.*

**HARISH:** You came back. I knew you would. I've been waiting.

**ARJUN:** I have more questions.

**HARISH:** No. I have something for you. Something I kept for eight years. (pushes bundle toward Arjun)

**ARJUN:** What is this?

**HARISH:** Open it.

*Arjun unwraps the cloth. Inside are yellowed papers, water-damaged but legible.*

**ARJUN:** These are...?

**HARISH:** My daughter found these three days before she died. She made copies. Hid them in place I didn't know until last year. When I was repairing her old bed frame, I found them. Hidden in hollow of the wood.

**ARJUN:** (reading) Talbed Survey Report. Dated... this is twelve years ago. Signed by Raghav Nimkar.

**HARISH:** The clerk who died of snakebite. That's what they said anyway.

**ARJUN:** (continues reading) This documents... this documents illegal talbed encroachment into protected common land. And it names... (stops)

**HARISH:** Keep reading.

**ARJUN:** "Materials being excavated and transported via Gokhale Bricks. Route established from Babhul through back roads. Revenue officer Bendre certifying false boundaries. Estimated encroachment: 12 hectares."

**HARISH:** Twelve hectares of protected talbed turned into brick material. For years. And my daughter found the proof.

**ARJUN:** This is signed by Nimkar but never filed.

**HARISH:** Because Nimkar died before he could file it. Snakebite. (bitter) And anyone who found this paper after him also died. My children. That woman who was Nimkar's wife. Maybe others we don't even know about.

**ARJUN:** Why didn't you bring this forward when you found it?

**HARISH:** (laughs hollow) Bring to whom? Police? They called it suicide. Sarpanch? He plays cards with the kiln people. Revenue office? They were taking bribes. I am one man. One broken man with a paper. Who would believe me?

**ARJUN:** I'm here now.

**HARISH:** (nods) You are different. CID from Pune. No connections here. Maybe you can do what I cannot. Or maybe they will kill you too. But at least... at least now someone knows. Someone can try.

**ARJUN:** This report mentions "expanding operations." What does that mean?

**HARISH:** (shrugs) I don't know all the details. But I talked to people. Quietly. Over years. The talbed mining was phase one. Making money. Then they got bigger ideas. Using the kiln fires for... other burning. Things that shouldn't be burned. Waste from hospitals. From factories. All goes into the fire. All becomes ash. All disappears.

**ARJUN:** Your children saw this?

**HARISH:** My children saw paper only. The report. They were asking questions about it. I think... I think the newer murders, the More children, they saw the burning itself. Different evidence. Same killers.

**ARJUN:** The name on this transport approval. Madhav Gokhale. He was young back then. Not even running the operation.

**HARISH:** (nods) That's what makes it worse. He was already killing to protect the business even before his brother made him partner. This is not man who became bad. This is man who was always bad. Always willing to do what must be done.

**ARJUN:** I need to keep these papers.

**HARISH:** Take them. Take everything. (grabs Arjun's arm) Just promise me. Promise you will finish this. My children cannot rest until someone speaks their names in a court. Until someone says they were murdered. Not cursed. Not suicide. Murdered.
