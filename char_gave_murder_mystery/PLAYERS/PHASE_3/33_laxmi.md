## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Kalyani's home is bare. She sits in shadow, wrapped in a white sari. She hasn't spoken to investigators before - this is her first interview in fifteen years. Leena's mother Sarla made the arrangement.*

**LEENA:** Thank you for seeing me. I know you don't talk to people about...

**KALYANI:** (voice rough from disuse) Your mother said you are different. Said you want truth, not gossip. I'm tired of carrying alone. Maybe it's time.

**LEENA:** Tell me about Ira and Asha.

**KALYANI:** (small smile) They were good children. Beautiful. Smart. Too smart maybe. They noticed things. They asked things. Even at eight, they asked.

**LEENA:** What did they ask?

**KALYANI:** Why we lived in Vasti but got money from Wada. Why Vasundhara-bai looked at them strange - sometimes with softness, sometimes with hate. Why they had light skin when Gopal and I are dark. (pause) Children notice. They just don't know what they're noticing.

**LEENA:** I need to ask directly. Were they Gopal's children?

**KALYANI:** (long silence) No.

**LEENA:** Whose?

**KALYANI:** Gadkari Saheb's. The zamindar's. (voice flat) I was eighteen. Working in Wada kitchen. He was... powerful. Kind at first. Then not kind. Then I was pregnant. He gave money. Made Gopal marry me - Gopal owed debts to Wada, had no choice. Everyone thought it was arranged marriage. Quick. Normal.

**LEENA:** Gopal knew?

**KALYANI:** From beginning. He never touched me. Not once. He was kind man. Raised them as his own even knowing. But he drank. From guilt maybe. From shame. He's dead now. Liver failed five years ago.

**LEENA:** Did Vasundhara-bai know?

**KALYANI:** (bitter laugh) She knew everything. She was the one who came to Vasti that night. Before wedding was even planned. She came to my mother's hut and she said... (voice hardens) ...she said "I know what you are. I know what's in your belly. You will marry who I say. You will take money and stay silent. If you ever make claim on my husband's name, I will destroy you."

**LEENA:** And the children? She knew they were...

**KALYANI:** His heirs. Real heirs. The son she had was born weak, sickly. He lives in Bombay now, wants nothing to do with village. But my children... they were healthy. Strong. Beautiful. And as they grew, they looked more and more like him. Everyone could see. Vasundhara could see most of all.

**LEENA:** You think she killed them?

**KALYANI:** (tears fall silently) I know she did. Not with her own hands. She wouldn't dirty herself. But she gave the order. To Raghoba. Her dog. Her shadow. He does what she says. Has always done.

**LEENA:** You saw something? Heard something?

**KALYANI:** That night. The night my children died. I was sick - someone gave me tea that made me sleep, I now think it was drugged - but I woke briefly. Heard voices outside. One was Raghoba. Saying "It's done. Both of them. It's done." I thought I was dreaming. Next morning my children were dead in the lake.

**LEENA:** Why didn't you tell anyone?

**KALYANI:** Tell whom? Against the zamindar's wife? With no proof? I went to constable. Tried to say something. Vasundhara was there before me. She told him I was mad with grief. That I was making up stories. He believed her. She is Wada. I am Vasti. Who believes Vasti over Wada?

**LEENA:** There may have been a deed. A trust document naming your children.

**KALYANI:** (looks up sharply) How do you know about that?

**LEENA:** The talathi found records. A mutation that was later cancelled.

**KALYANI:** Gadkari Saheb made it. In guilt. He put their names on land. Small piece, not much, but legal. Official. Proof that he acknowledged them. I didn't know until after they died. A man came - lawyer from Satara - saying the deed was cancelled because beneficiaries were deceased. That's when I understood. They didn't just die. They were killed so that paper would mean nothing.

**LEENA:** Do you still have any copy?

**KALYANI:** (shakes head) Everything was taken. The night after cremation, someone came to my hut. Searched everything. I pretended to sleep. I heard them. They took what little I had. Even the small gold studs my daughters wore. Even that.
