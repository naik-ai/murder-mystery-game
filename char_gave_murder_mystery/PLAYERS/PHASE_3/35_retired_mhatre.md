## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Bendre lives in a comfortable house - too comfortable for a retired government clerk. He's nervous when he sees CID identification. He tries to close the door but Arjun has already stepped inside.*

**BENDRE:** This is private property. You can't just...

**ARJUN:** I can arrest you for obstructing investigation. Or we can talk. Your choice.

**BENDRE:** (reluctantly opens door wider) What investigation? I'm retired. Ten years now. I don't know anything about anything.

**ARJUN:** Raghav Nimkar. You knew him.

**BENDRE:** (face pales) Nimkar. Yes. He worked under me. Died of snakebite. Sad thing.

**ARJUN:** I have his survey report. The one he was about to file before he died.

**BENDRE:** (sits down heavily) Report. What report?

**ARJUN:** The one documenting twelve hectares of protected talbed being excavated illegally. The one naming you as the officer who certified false boundaries.

**BENDRE:** (sweating) Where did you... that report was never... it was supposed to be destroyed.

**ARJUN:** It wasn't. Children found it. Children who are now dead. Just like Nimkar. Just like his wife.

**BENDRE:** (head in hands) I told them. I told them it would come out eventually. You can't bury truth forever. But they didn't listen. They said I was worrying about nothing.

**ARJUN:** Who said? Who told you not to worry?

**BENDRE:** (looks up, hollow) Madhav. Madhav Gokhale. And his contact at the taluka level. Some revenue officer. I never met him directly. Everything went through Madhav.

**ARJUN:** How much did they pay you?

**BENDRE:** (long pause) First time, fifty thousand. That was twelve years ago. I was in debt. Daughter's wedding. Medical bills for wife. I told myself it was one time. Just once. (bitter laugh) It's never one time.

**ARJUN:** And after?

**BENDRE:** Monthly. Five thousand. Sometimes ten. For looking the other way. For signing papers. For making problems disappear. When Nimkar started asking questions, they paid me extra to transfer him to different area. But he wouldn't transfer. Said he was close to something big.

**ARJUN:** Did you know they would kill him?

**BENDRE:** (whispers) No. I thought they would just... transfer him forcibly. Or threaten him. When I heard snakebite, I knew. I knew it wasn't snake. But what could I do? I was already in too deep. If I talked, I would go to jail. And they would... they would do to me what they did to him.

**ARJUN:** His wife came to you. After he died.

**BENDRE:** (nods) Asking about his work. Asking about what he found. I told her I didn't know. I told her to go home. To forget. She didn't listen. She kept asking people. Then she was dead too.

**ARJUN:** And the children? Eight years ago? The Karande children who found the report?

**BENDRE:** (breaks down crying) I didn't know until after. Madhav came to me. Said there was a situation. Said some children had old papers. Said it was handled. I asked what "handled" meant. He just smiled. That smile... (shudders) ...I see it in nightmares.

**ARJUN:** You're confessing to bribery, obstruction, and accessory to multiple murders.

**BENDRE:** (looks at Arjun directly) I am dying. Doctor says six months, maybe less. Liver. Same as everyone who drinks away their guilt. I have nothing left to protect. Take my statement. Record everything. Let it be known that I was a coward and a criminal. But also let it be known who the real killer is. Madhav Gokhale. He is the one. He is the center of everything.

**ARJUN:** What about the recent operations? The waste burning?

**BENDRE:** I don't know details. I've been retired. But I heard rumors. The brick business wasn't enough. They found new... revenue streams. Medical waste. Industrial waste. Things that need to disappear. The kiln fires burn hot enough. The lake is convenient for cooling ash. (pause) Whatever those children saw four months ago, it was this. The new operation. Bigger now. More dangerous.
