## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*The old zamindar sits in a large wooden chair, wrapped in shawl despite the heat. His eyes are distant. Leena has treated him for heart condition - he knows he doesn't have long. Vasundhara hovers near the door, but Arjun requests she leave. She does, reluctantly.*

**GADKARI SAHEB:** She doesn't like you. My wife. Says you ask too many questions.

**ARJUN:** Does that concern you?

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (weak smile) At my age, very little concerns me. I have months perhaps. What does it matter who asks questions?

**ARJUN:** I need to ask about the twins. Ira and Asha. From fifteen years ago.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (face clouds) Those children. (long silence) What do you know?

**ARJUN:** I know Kalyani worked here. I know you... were close to her. I know the children looked like you.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (tears form) They were mine. (voice breaks) My daughters. My blood. My only healthy children. The one I have with Vasundhara... he was sickly from birth. Never wanted the Wada. Left for Bombay. Never comes. But those twins... they were strong. Beautiful. Everything I wanted in heirs.

**ARJUN:** You acknowledged them? Legally?

**GADKARI SAHEB:** I tried. (coughs) I made a trust. Put land in their names. Not much - small parcel near the orchard - but enough to give them right. To acknowledge them as mine even if I couldn't do it publicly.

**ARJUN:** Vasundhara found out.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (nods slowly) She has spies everywhere. Even among people I trust. Someone told her about the deed. About the land. About... about my visits to see the children.

**ARJUN:** What did she do?

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (looks at door, lowers voice) We fought. The night before the puja. Terrible fight. She called me names. Called Kalyani names. Said I had shamed the family. Said those bastard children would never touch Gadkari property. I said they were my children. My decision. She went quiet then. Very quiet. That's when she's most dangerous - when she's quiet.

**ARJUN:** And the next night, the children were dead.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (weeping now) I didn't know. I swear I didn't know she would... I thought she would make legal trouble. Challenge the trust. Not... not murder. They were children. Eight years old. My children.

**ARJUN:** Did you confront her? After?

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (shakes head) I was afraid. She is... she is capable of things I cannot imagine. And I had no proof. Just suspicion. Just the timing. Just the way she looked at me when the news came - satisfied. Like a problem had been solved.

**ARJUN:** You've lived with her for fifteen years knowing this.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** I have lived in prison. This Wada is my prison. She is my jailer. I am old, sick, weak. What can I do? Go to police? Say I suspect my wife of killing my illegitimate children? They would laugh. Or worse.

**ARJUN:** There's been other deaths too. At that lake. Other children.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (confused) Other children? But those are... the curse. The twins' ghosts...

**ARJUN:** There are no ghosts. There are only murderers using the story your wife created.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (stares) What are you saying?

**ARJUN:** The curse narrative. It was invented to cover up what happened to your daughters. And now other people - the kiln people - are using that same cover to hide their own crimes. The legend your wife created has become a shield for multiple murderers.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (horror dawning) All these years... all the children who died at that lake... they were murdered? Like my daughters?

**ARJUN:** The later ones, yes. By different people. But the original murder - your daughters - that started everything.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (buries face in hands) I should have spoken. Years ago. I should have told someone. But I was weak. Selfish. Afraid. And now... now more children are dead because I kept silent.

**ARJUN:** It's not too late. You can testify. Against her. Tell the truth about what you know.

**GADKARI SAHEB:** (looks up, determination through tears) Yes. Yes, I will. Whatever time I have left, I will use it for truth. Write down what I say. Record it. Before she finds out you're here. Before she can stop me.
