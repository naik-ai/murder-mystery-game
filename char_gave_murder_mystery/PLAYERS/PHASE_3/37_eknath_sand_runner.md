## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Ravindra is muscular, weathered by outdoor work. He's loading sand onto a truck when Leena approaches. He stops, wary - he's used to police attention but not doctors.*

**RAVINDRA:** Doctor-bai? You're not here for sand license.

**LEENA:** No. I'm here about the children who died.

**RAVINDRA:** (laughs humorless) And you came to the sand thief. Everyone always comes to the sand thief. When something is stolen - ask Ravindra. When someone dies - ask Ravindra. I'm everyone's favorite suspect.

**LEENA:** Were you involved?

**RAVINDRA:** (drops shovel) No. I was not involved. I have stolen sand, yes. I have fought with revenue officers, yes. I have done illegal things, yes. But I have never hurt a child. Never.

**LEENA:** But you knew Raghav Nimkar. People say you threatened him.

**RAVINDRA:** (spits) Nimkar was honest man. Too honest. He caught me one night with a truckload. We shouted at each other. I said things I shouldn't have said. Angry things. But shout is not kill. Fight is not murder. Week later he was dead. Everyone looked at me. "Ravindra threatened him, Ravindra killed him."

**LEENA:** But you didn't?

**RAVINDRA:** Why would I kill over one truck of sand? I could bribe my way out. Everyone bribes. That's how it works. Kill a government officer over sand? That brings investigation, attention. I'm criminal but I'm not stupid.

**LEENA:** So who killed him?

**RAVINDRA:** (looks around, lowers voice) Nimkar wasn't investigating sand. He found bigger things. The talbed. The encroachment. Things that make my sand business look like child's game. Kiln people. That's who benefited from his death. Not me.

**LEENA:** You know this for certain?

**RAVINDRA:** I know because Madhav came to me after Nimkar died. Friendly visit. Said it was unfortunate about the officer. Said he hoped I had good alibi. Said if police asked questions, maybe I should say I was at home that night. He would provide witnesses.

**LEENA:** Madhav Gokhale offered you a fake alibi?

**RAVINDRA:** For nothing. Free. Very generous, no? Except what he really meant was: we know you look guilty, we're giving you escape, but now you owe us.

**LEENA:** Did you take it?

**RAVINDRA:** No. I had real alibi - I was in Kolhapur that night for sand buyer meeting. Police checked. They had to let me go. But Madhav's offer... that told me everything. He was cleaning up. Making sure attention stayed on me, not on him.

**LEENA:** What about the lake? The burning at night?

**RAVINDRA:** (face darkens) I stay away from lake. That place is wrong now. Not ghosts - I don't believe in ghosts - but something else. Fires that aren't cooking fires. Trucks that aren't brick trucks. Men who aren't kiln workers.

**LEENA:** Have you seen Madhav there?

**RAVINDRA:** Once. Late night. I was coming back from river. Saw his jeep on the back road. Not going to kiln. Going toward lake. With covered truck following. I didn't stop to ask questions.

**LEENA:** The More children. Did you know them?

**RAVINDRA:** The girl used to bring water to my workers sometimes. Friendly child. Curious. Too curious. She asked once what we were doing. I told her - taking sand that belongs to no one. She said everything belongs to someone. Smart answer for a twelve-year-old. (pause) Week after that, she was dead.

**LEENA:** Any idea why?

**RAVINDRA:** (meets her eyes) Because she saw something. Same reason the other children died. This place kills the curious. The ones who ask. The ones who see. You're asking questions now, doctor-bai. Be careful who hears.
