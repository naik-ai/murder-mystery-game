## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Prakash is brought in handcuffs. He's been avoiding eye contact since the arrest. His shirt sleeve is pushed up, revealing old scratch marks - now scars - on his forearm.*

**ARJUN:** The scratches. From Gauri More. Four months ago. They've healed but they haven't disappeared.

**PRAKASH:** (says nothing)

**ARJUN:** Her brother remembers. You grabbed her from behind. She fought. She scratched your face and arm. The boy says you were bleeding.

**PRAKASH:** (still silent)

**ARJUN:** Your wife told us you came home with wet clothes that night. That you haven't slept well since. That you said "They were children. They were just children."

**PRAKASH:** (flinches)

**ARJUN:** Dinesh watched from the kiln. He's given us everything. Times. Dates. Where the bodies went. What Madhav said to you afterward.

**PRAKASH:** (finally speaks) It wasn't supposed to happen.

**ARJUN:** What wasn't supposed to happen?

**PRAKASH:** (words tumbling out) The children. They weren't supposed to be there. No one was supposed to be there. It was routine. Just burning. Just ash. Then Madhav saw them. Hiding in the bushes. He said "Those kids saw everything." I said let them go. They're children. Who will believe them? But Madhav...

**ARJUN:** What did Madhav do?

**PRAKASH:** He grabbed the girl. Said witnesses are witnesses, doesn't matter the age. Said we finish this now or we all go to jail. I said please, let's just scare them. Make them promise to stay quiet. But he... he put her in the water. Held her down. Made me hold her legs. She was thrashing. Fighting. Scratching. And then she stopped.

**ARJUN:** You held her legs while she drowned.

**PRAKASH:** (crying) I told him no. Over and over. I said this is too much. This is murder. But he's Madhav-saheb. I work for him. My father worked for his father. My whole family owes them. I couldn't... I couldn't refuse him. Not even for that.

**ARJUN:** The boy escaped.

**PRAKASH:** I let him. I saw him running and I... I didn't chase fast enough. On purpose. I couldn't. Not two. I couldn't do it to two. The girl was already... already gone. I couldn't stop what happened. But the boy... I pretended I couldn't catch him.

**ARJUN:** You let him escape but you didn't let him see you stop chasing.

**PRAKASH:** If Madhav knew I let him go... he would have killed me. Killed my family. He said later the boy ran too fast. I said yes. Too fast. Didn't tell him I slowed down. Didn't tell him I fell on purpose in the dark.

**ARJUN:** The Karande children. Eight years ago. Were you involved in those?

**PRAKASH:** (shakes head) I was young then. Working at the kiln but not... not in the night business. That was Madhav and his own people. I only got involved later. When the waste burning started. They needed someone to drive trucks. I needed money. My father was sick. I thought it was just garbage. Just illegal burning. I didn't know about...

**ARJUN:** But you knew after. You knew about the Karande children after.

**PRAKASH:** (nods) Everyone who works close to Madhav knows. You don't talk about it. You don't ask about it. But you know. The lake is... the lake has many secrets. Many bodies. Not just children.

**ARJUN:** What do you mean?

**PRAKASH:** People who asked questions. People who saw too much. Over the years. Nimkar the clerk. His wife. Old man who complained about the smoke. All "accidents." All "natural." All in or near that lake. Madhav has been solving problems that way for years.

**ARJUN:** You'll testify to all of this?

**PRAKASH:** (looks up, hollow) What choice do I have? I'm already dead. When Madhav finds out I talked... even in jail... he has reach. But at least... at least I can say it. Say what I did. Let them judge me. Let the girl's family know... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I should have died instead of letting him... instead of helping him...
