## INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT

*Dinesh is brought to the police station for formal questioning. He's shaking. The "ghost" story isn't working anymore. Arjun has photographs and documents spread on the table.*

**ARJUN:** The ghosts you saw. Two white shapes near the water. One of them is alive. He's eight years old. He remembers everything.

**DINESH:** (face drains) The boy...

**ARJUN:** Aarav More. He identified the men. He described the fires. The bags. The truck. (pause) He described what happened to his sister.

**DINESH:** I didn't... I wasn't...

**ARJUN:** You weren't what? There? You just told me in your first interview that you saw shapes near the water that night. You said one disappeared. Then another. Then darkness.

**DINESH:** I thought... I said I thought they were ghosts...

**ARJUN:** You didn't think they were ghosts. You knew exactly what they were. You watched a child being killed and you did nothing.

**DINESH:** (breaks down) I couldn't! I couldn't do anything! Madhav-saheb... if I said anything... if I even looked wrong...

**ARJUN:** So you watched.

**DINESH:** (sobbing) I heard her scream. The girl. And then... then I heard the water. Splashing. I turned away. I went back to the kiln. I told myself I saw nothing. I saw ghosts. Just ghosts.

**ARJUN:** You've been seeing ghosts for years, haven't you? Every time those trucks came. Every time the fires burned. Every time you smelled that chemical smoke.

**DINESH:** (nods miserably) They told me - Madhav-saheb told me - the trucks are not your business. What burns is not your business. You watch the kilns. That's all. That's all you do.

**ARJUN:** How often did the trucks come?

**DINESH:** (gives up) Two, three times a month. Sometimes more. Always late night. Always from Sangli side. Hospital waste. Factory waste. Things they couldn't dispose legally. Madhav-saheb had arrangement. They paid him. He burned it. Everyone looked away.

**ARJUN:** The burning location?

**DINESH:** Old pit. Near the lake. Used to be for surplus brick firing years ago. Now it's just for... for the other burning. The ash goes into the lake. By morning, nothing is left. Just water and smoke.

**ARJUN:** And when children came?

**DINESH:** (voice hollow) It happened before. The Karande children. Eight years ago. I was still new then. Didn't understand. But I saw men chase them. Saw them drag them toward the lake. Heard them scream. Then nothing. Next morning, police came. Suicide, they said. And I knew. I knew it wasn't suicide. But I said nothing.

**ARJUN:** Twice. You watched children die twice.

**DINESH:** (wailing) I have daughters! I have family! If I spoke, they would kill me! They would kill my children! Madhav-saheb made that clear. He said - one word, one question, and your girls swim in that lake too. What was I supposed to do?

**ARJUN:** You were supposed to be human.

**DINESH:** (collapses on table) I know. I know. I'm not human. I'm dog. I watch. I obey. I stay alive. That's all I am. (looks up) Take my testimony. Write everything. I'll tell you dates, times, trucks. Everything I remember. Let me... let me at least die with some of the truth spoken.
