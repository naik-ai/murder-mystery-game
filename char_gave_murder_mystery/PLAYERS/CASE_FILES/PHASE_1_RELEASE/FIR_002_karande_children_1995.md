### SECTION VI - WITNESS STATEMENTS (SUMMARY)

**Shri Harish Karande (father):**
"My children were good children. They studied well. I don't know why they went to that cursed lake. Everyone knows twin ghosts are there. Maybe they wanted to see. Maybe ghosts took them."

**Smt. Nirmala Karande (mother):**
"Neelam was excited about something few days before. She said she and Omkar found something important. I asked what but she said it was secret. Now they are dead and I will never know what secret killed my children."

**Shri Bhau Patil (discovered bodies):**
"I was checking my field. I saw something in water. When I got close I saw it was bodies. Children from village. I ran to tell. That lake has always been bad. After the twins died there, it became worse. Now more children."

**Smt. Shaila Jore (school teacher):**
"These children were curious. Bright. Neelam especially asked many questions. Last week she asked about forest boundaries and government papers. I told her such things are not for children. She laughed and said she already knew secrets. I didn't think..."

### SECTION VII - CIRCUMSTANCES ANALYSIS

The following factors indicate suicide:

1. Children went to lake voluntarily (no forced movement evidence)
2. No external injuries suggesting violence
3. Lake has history of similar incident (1988 twin drowning)
4. Village-wide belief in curse may have influenced children mentally
5. No robbery (belongings intact)
6. Both entered water together (mutual decision)
7. No known enemies or disputes involving children

**Alternative considered:** Accidental drowning
- However, water level was not unusually high
- Children were old enough to swim away from shallow bank area
- Deliberate entry into deep water more consistent

**Recommendation:** Case to be registered as Suicide (Section 309 IPC not applicable to deceased). Register as Unnatural Death requiring Inquest only.

---

### SECTION VIII - ACTION TAKEN

Case registered as Unnatural Death - Suicide
ADR No. 08/1995

Post-mortem: Recommended but family requested waiver citing religious reasons. Taluka Medical Officer consulted. Given clear drowning indication and no foul play markers, post-mortem waived.

Case referred to Magistrate for closure.
