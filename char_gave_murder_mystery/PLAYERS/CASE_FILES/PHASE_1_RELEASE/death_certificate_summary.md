## OBSERVATIONS (For Internal Review Only)

1. **Pattern of No Post-Mortems:** In all five cases, post-mortem was waived citing family religious objections. While common in rural areas, the consistent avoidance is notable.

2. **Time of Death Estimates:**
   - T1 (1988): Estimated 4-6 hours before discovery (evening to early morning)
   - T2 (1995): Estimated 12+ hours before discovery (time unclear)
   - T3 (2002): Estimated 8-12 hours before discovery

3. **Physical Findings (Limited):**
   - All victims showed standard drowning presentation
   - T2 victim Neelam noted with "eyes open" - can indicate sudden death or fear at time of death
   - No defensive injuries noted in any case (brief examinations)
   - T3 survivor had abrasions - from fleeing, per account

4. **Medical Officer Rotation:**
   - 1988: Dr. Kulkarni (transferred 1990)
   - 1995: Dr. Deshmukh (transferred 1999)
   - 2002: Dr. Pande (transferred 2002, shortly after this case)
   - Current: Dr. Leena Shirke (posted December 2002)

5. **Access to Original Records:**
   - 1988 records: Minimal documentation, handwritten register only
   - 1995 records: Slightly more detailed, typed form
   - 2002 records: Most complete, but still basic

**Note by Dr. Leena Shirke (January 2003):**

I was asked by CID to compile these records. I have done so faithfully from available documentation.

However, I note that none of these deaths received proper medical investigation. Visual examination alone cannot rule out other causes masked as drowning. Without toxicology, without detailed autopsy, we cannot confirm that drowning was the primary cause vs. secondary to some other factor.

The consistency of outcome (drowning) combined with the consistency of process (no post-mortem, quick release) raises procedural questions that fall outside medical scope but may warrant administrative review.
