## SECTION E: SUMMARY ANALYSIS

### Payment Matrix

| Recipient | Payments From | Start Date | Linked Event | Monthly Amount |
|-----------|--------------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Kalyani | Gadkari (Wada) | Aug 1988 | Twin deaths | Rs. 500 |
| Kalyani | Raut | Sep 1988 | Twin deaths | Rs. 200 |
| Sarla Shirke | Raut | Aug 1988 | Twin deaths | Rs. 150 |

| More family | Anonymous->Raut | Oct 2002 | More death | Rs. 400 |

### Observations:

1. **Timing Pattern:** All payment streams begin within 1-2 months of a child death incident at Korde Tal.

2. **Raut Family Role:** Vishnu Raut (and later son Nilesh) sends to ALL victim families and to Sarla Shirke. Connection unclear.

3. **Anonymous Deposits:** Begin immediately after deaths (Karande, More). Convert to named Raut payments within 6-12 months. Same pattern both times.

4. **Newspaper Wrapper:** Anonymous 1995 deposit was wrapped in paper with Gokhale Brothers advertisement. May indicate origin.

5. **Gadkari Payments:** Only go to Kalyani (T1 victim family). No payments to T2 or T3 families from Wada.

6. **Sarla Shirke:** Receives payments from Raut since 1988. She is friend of Kalyani, from Vasti. No known employment relationship. Purpose of payments unexplained.

## SECTION F: ADDITIONAL DETAILS

### Cash Deposit Procedure Notes:

Per postal regulations, cash deposits over Rs. 100 should have sender identification recorded. However, in practice, small village branches may accept deposits without full documentation if:
- Depositor is known to staff
- Amount is small
- Recipient is local

In cases of anonymous deposits to Karande and More families:
- Depositor was not identified by name
- Staff member who accepted (now retired) stated depositor "looked like kiln worker"
- No further identification available

---

### Register Storage:

Original registers for periods:
- 1988-1992: Stored in district postal archive
- 1993-1997: Stored at branch (basement)
- 1998-present: Current active storage

Some water damage to 1993-1995 registers. Some entries partially illegible.

### PERSONAL NOTE (Separate sheet, unsigned):

> These payment patterns have troubled me for years.
> Why do kiln people pay victim families?
> Why anonymously at first?
> Why does it always start after children die?
>
> I never asked questions. It was not my business.
> But when CID came asking, I knew it was time.
>
> The truth is in these numbers. Someone just needs to read them properly.
