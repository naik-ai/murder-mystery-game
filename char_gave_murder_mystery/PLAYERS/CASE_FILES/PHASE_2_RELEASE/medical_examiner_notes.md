---

#### QUESTIONS RAISED (Not entered in official record):

1. Petechial hemorrhaging in eyes can indicate asphyxiation. Consistent with drowning. But also with manual strangulation.

2. Parallel marks on left forearm - what caused these? Not consistent with tree branches or rocks. More consistent with... grip? Two fingers pressing?

3. Right wrist discoloration - could be post-mortem artifact. Could also be pre-mortem restraint.

4. Without internal examination, cannot confirm water in lungs vs. dry drowning vs. other asphyxiation mechanism.

5. Position of body (face-down) and fixed lividity - was body moved after death?

---

#### OFFICIAL FINDING:

Cause of death: Asphyxia due to drowning.
Manner: Appears consistent with suicide/accidental death per police determination.

---

#### UNOFFICIAL NOTES (Personal):

I am recording this separately because official forms do not allow for uncertainty.

The marks on this child's arm trouble me. I have seen many drowning cases in 15 years. Drowning victims who struggle show chaotic injury patterns - grabbing at anything. These marks are too regular. Too parallel. Like someone held her arm.

I asked police about examining the area for evidence. Constable Ghadge said case is clear. No need for additional investigation.

I asked about the survivor boy. Wanted to examine him more thoroughly. Family took him away before I could do complete assessment.

I am scheduled for transfer next month. Perhaps I should let this go.

### HISTORICAL COMPARISON - 1995 CASE

*Notes found in old file cabinet, handwritten by previous MO*

**Dr. S. P. Deshmukh's notes on Karande children (1995):**

> Girl's (Neelam) eyes were open and showed significant conjunctival hemorrhage. More than typical drowning. Boy (Omkar) similar but less pronounced.

> Both children had wrinkled fingers from water immersion but also showed slight puckering around mouth area. Reason unclear.

> Faint marks on girl's upper arms - bilateral. Dismissed as environmental (brambles near lake).

> Family very insistent on quick release. Sarpanch came personally to expedite. Certificate issued same day.

> I have concerns but no evidence. Without PM, impossible to say more.

---

### HISTORICAL COMPARISON - 1988 CASE

*Minimal notes found. Register entry only:*

**PHC Register, July 1988:**

> Twin girls, 8 years each. Drowning death. Visual exam only.
> Bodies brought quickly by family and village people. Zamindar's servant present.
> One child (Ira) showed mild bruising on back of head - noted as possible striking against rocks during drowning.
> Other child (Asha) - eyes open, expression of fear noted. Natural for drowning victim.
> No detailed notes. Case clear. No PM requested or conducted.
> Released within hours.

---

## TOXICOLOGY OBSERVATIONS (Never Formally Tested)

*From Dr. Pande's personal diary, found in drawer:*

**Entry dated October 2002:**

> I have been thinking about the More child case.

> The lake water - I collected a sample informally. Did basic testing at district hospital when I went for meeting.

> Results concerning:
> - pH abnormally high (alkaline)
> - Traces of... something chemical. They could not identify precisely without full lab work.
> - Faint smell of something medical. Antiseptic? Formaldehyde? Cannot say.

> This is not normal lake water. Something is contaminating it.

> I mentioned to Sarpanch that lake should be tested. He said village has bigger problems. Said I should focus on living patients, not dead children.

> I am transferring soon. I have written to district health officer about water quality concern. No response yet.

**Entry dated November 2002:**

> Transfer orders received. Pune posting. I am relieved.

> I leave behind unanswered questions:
> - What is in that lake?
> - Why do children keep dying there?
> - Why does no one want to investigate?

> Perhaps new doctor will have fresh eyes. Perhaps not.

> I have left my notes in the file cabinet. Officially, they don't exist. Unofficially, they are waiting for someone who wants to find them.

## SUMMARY OBSERVATIONS

**Pattern Across Cases:**

| Year | Victim | Eyes | Marks/Bruising | Post-Mortem |
|------|--------|------|----------------|-------------|
| 1988 | Ira | N/A | Back of head | No |
| 1988 | Asha | Open, fearful | None noted | No |
| 1995 | Neelam | Open, hemorrhage | Upper arms (bilateral) | No |
| 1995 | Omkar | Some hemorrhage | None noted | No |
| 2002 | Gauri | Open, hemorrhage | Left forearm (parallel), right wrist | No |

**Recurring Elements:**
- Eyes frequently found open
- Conjunctival hemorrhaging (not always present in simple drowning)
- Unexplained marks dismissed as environmental
- No toxicology ever performed
- Quick release of bodies in all cases
- Presence of influential persons (zamindar's people, sarpanch) expediting process
