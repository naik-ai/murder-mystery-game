## DOCUMENT PROVENANCE NOTE

*Added by Dr. Leena Shirke, January 2003:*

This document was found by Shri Harish Karande among his deceased children's belongings. According to Harish, his children Neelam and Omkar found this partially burned report in an abandoned forest office building near Babhul in February or March 1995, approximately two weeks before their deaths.

The children had shown interest in the document and asked questions about "government papers" and "forest boundaries" to their teacher.

Harish preserved the document but did not understand its significance. He believed it was connected to why his children went to the forest and subsequently to the lake.

The document author, Raghav Nimkar, died of snakebite in September 1985, approximately three months after completing this survey. His widow Leelabai Nimkar died in 1998, ruled as suicide.

Original document condition: Approximately 40% recoverable. Water damage consistent with lake immersion. Fire damage appears older, possibly from attempted destruction before discarding at forest office.

*Document retained for CID investigation.*
*Chain of custody: Harish Karande -> Dr. Leena Shirke -> CID (Arjun Gadkari)*
