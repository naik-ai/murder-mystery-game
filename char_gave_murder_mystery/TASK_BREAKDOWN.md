# TASK BREAKDOWN
## Murder Mystery Game - Remaining Work and Revisions

**Generated:** 2026-01-04
**Status:** Active Development

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State:
- **Total Interviews Planned:** 50
- **Interviews Written:** 27
- **Interviews Remaining:** 23
- **Case Files Written:** 0
- **Moderator Guide Written:** 0

### Audit Issues to Address:
1. Dead giveaways too early in Phase 2
2. Dialogue too expository - characters state story logic explicitly
3. Phase 4 confessions "hand you" the ending
4. T1 motive (land deed) needs emotional dramatization
5. Many voices share same cadence - need distinct speech patterns
6. Post-interview analysis may solve mystery for players

---

## SECTION 3: INTERVIEWS REQUIRING REVISION

### PRIORITY 1 - Major Revisions (Audit Issues)

#### Interview 12 (Teacher Kulkarni) - Phase 1
**Problem:** Too expository. Teacher directly states pattern and suspects.
**Current issues:**
- Lines like "Madhav came back from city ten years ago. Things changed after that"
- Directly suggests Madhav is involved
- Provides analysis players should make themselves

**Fix approach:**
- Remove direct Madhav connection
- Make observations more scattered, less conclusive
- Have teacher hint at pattern without naming it
- Remove post-interview analysis that solves mystery

---

#### Interview 16 (Aarav More) - Phase 2
**Problem:** Post-interview analysis directly states "this was murder"
**Current issues:**
- Analysis says "Ghosts don't smell like kilns. Ghosts don't drive trucks."
- Conclusions drawn for player
- "This was not supernatural - this was murder" is too direct

**Fix approach:**
- Rewrite post-interview analysis to list FACTS only
- Remove interpretive statements
- Let players connect kiln smell to kiln workers
- Remove "This Interview Unlocks" section or make it procedural only

---

#### Interview 17 (Sarla Shirke) - Phase 2
**Problem:** Reveals too much too early, too expository
**Current issues:**
- Sarla says "old sins vs new sins" - confirms two conspiracies too early
- Directly tells daughter about Kalyani's drawings pointing to Wada
- Post-interview notes say "Clear confirmation: T1 and T2-T3 are DIFFERENT killers"

**Fix approach:**
- Sarla should be more protective, less forthcoming
- Save Kalyani's drawings reveal for Phase 3
- Remove direct conspiracy confirmation
- Make information harder to extract

---

#### Interview 39 (Sunita Dhere) - Phase 3
**Problem:** Direct overheard confession is too easy
**Current issues:**
- "Those children saw us" is a dead giveaway
- Madhav and Prakash directly named
- No ambiguity - hands solution to players

**Fix approach:**
- Make overheard conversation more fragmentary
- Sunita should be less certain what she heard
- Add noise/uncertainty to her memory
- Consider: she heard SOMETHING but not exact words
- Players should have to interpret, not just receive

---

#### Interview 46 (Madhav Confession) - Phase 4
**Problem:** Confession is too complete and too easy
**Current issues:**
- Madhav confesses fully with minimal pressure
- Provides complete motive explanation
- "Yes. I killed them. All four." - too clean

**Fix approach:**
- Require multiple pieces of evidence to break him
- Initial denials should be stronger
- Confession should come in pieces, not all at once
- Make players work for each admission
- Consider: he admits presence but denies killing initially

---

#### Interview 47 (Raghoba Confession) - Phase 4
**Problem:** Confession too complete, too emotional, hands ending
**Current issues:**
- Breaks immediately when confronted
- Provides full narrative unprompted
- Very detailed confession without resistance

**Fix approach:**
- Initial denial phase
- Require specific evidence (Haribhau's wet clothes observation)
- Confession should need multiple rounds
- Hold back some details until pressed
- Make players earn the full picture

---

### PRIORITY 2 - Voice and Cadence Work

The following interviews need voice distinctiveness work:

**Constable interviews (01, 02, 03):**
- Currently all sound the same
- Each should have subtle variations based on which case being discussed
- T3 should be more defensive (recent), T1 more distant/rehearsed

**Victim family voices (06, 07, 09, 10):**
- Currently similar "grieving parent" template
- Each family should have distinct speech patterns
- More family should be more raw (recent), Karande family more resigned
- Differentiate between fathers and mothers

**Kiln worker voices (18, 20, 21):**
- Need more distinct working-class patterns
- Vary education levels and articulateness
- Some more verbose, some more taciturn

---

## SECTION 9: SPECIAL NOTES

### T1 Motive Dramatization
The audit noted T1 motive (land deed/inheritance) needs more emotional weight. Key interviews to address this:

1. **Interview 41 (Gadkari Saheb):** Must show his genuine love for the twins, his guilt, his broken state. This is the emotional heart of T1.

2. **Interview 33 (Kalyani):** Her silence must be eloquent. Use gesture/drawing descriptions to show her grief and her knowledge.

3. **Interview 42 (Vasundhara Phase 3):** Her coldness must contrast with Gadkari's grief. Show her as the steel behind the tragedy.

4. **Interview 48 (Vasundhara Phase 4):** Her confession should reveal not just facts but her worldview - class, honor, what women "must do" to protect family.

### Voice Distinctiveness Guide
Create distinct speech patterns for:

| Character Type | Pattern Example |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Upper caste elderly | Long sentences, formal address, references to tradition |
| Upper caste female | Measured, controlled, indirect accusations |
| Middle class male | Business-like, status-conscious, mix of formal/casual |
| Working class | Short sentences, direct, emotional, dialect markers |
| Traumatized | Fragmented, ellipses, incomplete thoughts, non-sequiturs |
| Evasive/Guilty | Subject changes, deflection, rehearsed responses |
| Child (Aarav) | Simple words, sensory focus, magical thinking |

### Post-Interview Analysis Reform
All post-interview analyses should follow this structure:

```markdown
## POST-INTERVIEW ANALYSIS

### Facts Established:
- [Bullet list of verifiable facts only]

### Statements Made:
- [What the character claimed - not whether true]

### Behavioral Observations:
- [Physical tells, emotional state - no interpretation]

### Questions Raised:
- [What doesn't add up - phrased as questions]

### Connections to Other Interviews:
- [What other testimony relates - factual cross-reference only]
```

REMOVE from all analyses:
- "This means..."
- "The killer is..."
- "This proves..."
- "This was murder, not accident"
- Any direct conclusions
