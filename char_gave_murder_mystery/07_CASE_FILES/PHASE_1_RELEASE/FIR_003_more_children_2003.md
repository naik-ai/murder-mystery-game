On evening of 14-09-2002, children Gauri (12) and Aarav (8) of complainant Shri Raghunath More left home approximately 17:00 hrs. Mother Smt. Meena More states children said they were going to play near the common grazing ground.

When children did not return by dark (approx. 19:30 hrs), parents became worried. Search was organized with help of neighbors.

Search continued through night. Due to heavy fog (dhuke) in low-lying areas, visibility was poor.

- At 06:45 hrs, young boy Aarav was discovered by Shri Tukaram Bhatkar (farmer) in the fog area (dhuke), approximately 2 km from lake. Boy was in state of shock, unable to speak coherently, clothes muddy, minor scratches on arms.
- At 08:00 hrs, body of Gauri More discovered in Korde Tal by search party. Body floating near western bank.

### SECTION V - INQUEST OBSERVATIONS

**Attending Officer:** Constable Mohan Ghadge (Badge No. 1847)
**Date of Inquest:** 15-09-2002

**Body of Gauri More:**
- Female, approx 12 years age
- Wearing salwar kameez (pink color)
- Position: face-down in water, approx 12 meters from bank
- No visible external injuries on exposed areas
- Standard drowning presentation observed
- Eyes: open
- Hands: clenched (rigor may have set in)

**Personal Effects:**
- Clothing as described
- One black rubber hair band
- No shoes (feet bare)

**Survivor Aarav More - Preliminary Statement:**

Child was extremely disturbed. Kept repeating "bhaoot aale, bhaoot aale" (ghosts came). When asked what happened, child stated:

"We were near the big water. Tai said something smells. Then two big shadows came. They had cloth on face. They took Tai. I ran. In the fog I ran. I heard Tai screaming. Then no sound. I hid all night."

Child was unable to give further coherent statement. Medical examination recommended for trauma assessment.

**Interpretation:** Child clearly traumatized. His description of "two big shadows with cloth on face" is consistent with ghost legends in village. The "cloth on face" matches traditional depiction of spirits. Child has absorbed local superstition and interpreted whatever he saw through that lens.

### SECTION VI - SCENE OBSERVATIONS

- Lake area showed signs of recent activity (tire marks on far bank - likely farmers or forest workers)
- Some burnt material observed near water edge (ash, possibly village waste burning as is common)
- Fog (dhuke) was particularly dense on night of incident - reduced visibility to few meters
- No signs of struggle at immediate water edge
- No other witnesses present at time of incident

---

### SECTION VII - WITNESS STATEMENTS (SUMMARY)

**Shri Raghunath More (father):**
"The curse has taken my daughter. Same lake. Same way. Third time children have died. This lake is evil. Please, just give me my daughter's body. I want to perform rites."

**Smt. Meena More (mother):**
"I told them not to go that side. Everyone knows. But children don't listen. Now my Gauri is gone. My Aarav is alive but his mind is broken. What have we done to deserve this?"

**Shri Mahesh More (uncle of deceased):**
"My brother and I had some disputes before. About ancestral land. Some people are saying I had something to do with this. This is lie. I was at my house whole evening. My wife and children can confirm. This is ghost curse, not human work."

**Sarpanch Vilas Patre:**
"This tragedy has happened again. Village is living in fear. We need temple protection, not police investigation. The spirits are angry. We must do special pooja."

---

### SECTION VIII - ANALYSIS

**Cause of Death:** Drowning (consistent with previous incidents at same location)

**Circumstances:**
- Two children went to lake area
- One child drowned
- One child escaped and was found next day
- Survivor's account references supernatural elements (ghosts, shadows)
- Village history shows pattern of similar incidents (1988, 1995)
- No evidence of third party involvement
- Child survivor's testimony unreliable due to trauma and supernatural interpretation

**Conclusion:** Death by drowning. Ruled as Suicide/Accidental Death under influence of local curse belief. Children may have been attempting to "see the ghosts" as has been known to happen with village children.

**ENDORSEMENT:**

### INTERNAL FILE NOTE (Not for Public Record):

Survivor child Aarav More has been taken by family. Current whereabouts: believed to be with mother's relatives but exact location not confirmed with this office.

Child's testimony regarding "two big shadows with cloth on face" noted. Given the age of child (8 years) and traumatic circumstances, testimony is unreliable for evidentiary purposes. The description matches local legend of twin ghost girls.

However, child also mentioned "smell like clinic" - this detail is unexplained but may be hallucination from shock.

No follow-up deemed necessary.
