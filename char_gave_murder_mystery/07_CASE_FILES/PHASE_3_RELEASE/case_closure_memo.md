One survivor exists from incident 3: Aarav More (age 8).

## REVIEW UNDERTAKEN

Upon receiving informal communication from Central Investigation Department (CID) Pune regarding possible pattern in these incidents, this office undertook a review of available documentation, including:

1. Police First Information Reports (3 nos.)
2. Inquest reports (3 nos.)
3. Death certificates (5 nos.)
4. Statement of survivor (1 no., partial)
5. Village officials' inputs

---

## FINDINGS

### A. Regarding Individual Incidents

**Incident 1 (1988 - Twin Girls):**
The deaths were ruled accidental drowning resulting from flash flood conditions during monsoon. Investigation was conducted appropriately for the circumstances. No evidence of foul play was found. Case properly closed as Accidental Death Report (ADR).

**Incident 2 (1995 - Karande Siblings):**
The deaths were ruled suicide. While the children had no documented history of mental disturbance, the village environment with prevalent belief in supernatural curse may have influenced their actions. No evidence of third party involvement was found. Case properly closed.

**Incident 3 (2002 - More Child):**
Death ruled suicide, consistent with previous incidents. Survivor's testimony references supernatural elements (ghosts, shadows) which are not admissible as evidence of human perpetrators. No physical evidence of foul play recovered. Case properly closed.

### B. Regarding Pattern Theory

The CID communication suggested that the pattern of child deaths (always pairs, always at same location, same ruling) warrants deeper investigation.

This office has considered this suggestion and notes:

1. All three incidents occurred at the same location (Korde Tal)
2. All victims were minors
3. All cases were ruled without foul play
4. All post-mortem examinations were waived
5. No accused was ever identified

However, we also note:

1. Time gap between incidents (7 years between 1 and 2, 7 years between 2 and 3) is inconsistent with serial perpetrator behavior
2. Village has strong cultural belief in supernatural curse, which adequately explains recurrence
3. No witnesses have come forward with evidence of criminal activity
4. Local investigation resources confirm no suspicious circumstances

### C. Regarding Procedural Adequacy

Some procedural questions were raised:

- Why no post-mortem conducted in any case?
- Why was survivor child's location not recorded?
- Why minimal investigation despite pattern?

We note that:

- Post-mortem waiver is permitted when external examination is conclusive and family objects on religious grounds
- Survivor location is family matter, not police requirement for closed case
- Investigation resources are allocated based on available evidence, which did not indicate criminal activity

---

## CONCLUSIONS

Based on the review of available documentation and inputs from local officials, this office concludes:

1. **No evidence exists to suggest that any of the three incidents involved criminal activity.** The deaths appear to be tragic accidents and/or suicides influenced by local superstition.

2. **The pattern theory** (that incidents are connected and indicate ongoing criminal conspiracy) **is not supported by evidence.** While the coincidences are notable, coincidence alone does not constitute grounds for criminal investigation.

3. **Local investigation procedures** were adequate for the circumstances, though some documentation improvements could be recommended.

4. **No further investigation is warranted** under the current evidence status.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Lake Safety:** The Sarpanch and Block Development Officer should implement warning signage and fencing around Korde Tal to prevent future accidental drownings.

2. **Mental Health Outreach:** Given the apparent influence of superstition on vulnerable minds, the PHC should be directed to conduct awareness programs.

3. **Documentation Standards:** The police chowki should be reminded to maintain complete records including survivor locations in future cases.

4. **Case Files:** All three cases shall remain closed unless new substantive evidence emerges.

---

## DIRECTIVE

In light of above, all addressees are directed to:

1. Consider the matter closed
2. File correspondence accordingly
3. Implement recommendations as applicable
4. Not entertain further inquiries on closed cases without written orders from District level or above

Any new evidence, if obtained, should be routed through proper channels for assessment before any investigation is reopened.
