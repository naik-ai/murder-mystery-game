## CORE PREMISE

A cluster of four isolated villages in Maharashtra is gripped by fear. Over 15 years, six children have died in pairs - all ruled as suicides by drowning, all attributed to a local curse: the vengeful spirits of twin girls who drowned in the lake.

Two investigators - a local doctor returning home and a CID officer with a hidden connection - must untangle truth from superstition. The player assists them by analyzing interviews, spotting contradictions, and connecting evidence across timelines.

**The twist:** There are TWO separate murder conspiracies, committed by different killers for different reasons, both hiding behind the same ghost legend.

## THE THREE TIMELINES

| Timeline | When | Victims | Killer | Motive |
|----------|------|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | 15 years ago | Ira & Asha (twins, age 8) | Vasundhara via servant Raghoba | Silence heirs named in a hidden land deed |
| 2 | 8 years ago | Neelam & Omkar Karande (14, 12) | Madhav Gokhale | Children found a survey report on talbed encroachment |
| 3 | 4 months ago | Gauri & Aarav More (12, 8) - Aarav escaped | Madhav Gokhale | Children witnessed illegal medical waste burning at Tal |

---

## KEY REVELATION STRUCTURE

- **Timeline 1** is completely isolated from Timelines 2-3
- Different killers, different motives, same cover story
- Madhav Gokhale (Timeline 2-3) did NOT create the curse legend - he exploited one that already existed
- Vasundhara (Timeline 1) created the curse legend to cover her crime
- This makes the mystery harder to solve: investigators assume one killer, but there are two

## THE INVESTIGATORS

## THE FOUR KILN FAMILIES

| Family | Head | Role | Guilt Level |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Gokhale | Devrao (elder), Madhav (younger) | Main operation | Madhav is THE KILLER; Devrao is innocent |
| Kore | Prakash | Transport, muscle | Accomplice to Madhav (Timeline 3) |
| Sawant | Ajit | Earthmover contractor | Knows talbed encroachment, not murders |
| Raut | Nilesh (inherited from Vishnu) | Small kiln | Innocent, paying guilt money unknowingly |

---

## GHOST AMBIGUITY RULE

**Critical:** Until Phase 4, the supernatural explanation must remain viable.

| Phase | Ghost Status | Player Feeling |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | Completely believable | "Maybe it IS a curse" |
| 2 | Cracks appear | "Something's off, but curse still possible" |
| 3 | Pattern emerges | "Human involvement likely, but how?" |
| 4 | Truth revealed | "It was human all along" |
