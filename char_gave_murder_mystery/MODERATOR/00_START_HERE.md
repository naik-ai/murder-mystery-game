## QUICK ANSWER KEY

| Timeline | Victims | Killer(s) | Motive |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **T1** (15 yrs ago) | Twin girls Ira & Asha | **Vasundhara** (mastermind) + **Raghoba** (executor) | Trust deed named twins as heirs |
| **T2** (8 yrs ago) | Karande siblings | **Madhav Gokhale** | Children found survey report on encroachment |
| **T3** (4 months ago) | Gauri More | **Madhav** + **Prakash Kore** | Children witnessed medical waste burning |

**THE TWIST:** Two separate conspiracies by different killers, both using the same ghost story as cover.

## RUNNING THE GAME

### Phase 1 (Interviews 01-15)
- Release all Phase 1 interviews + Phase 1 case files
- Maintain supernatural ambiguity
- Players should feel "maybe it really is a curse"

### Phase 2 (Interviews 16-30)
- Release after Phase 1 complete
- Aarav's testimony is KEY (Interview 16)
- Players should start suspecting human involvement

### Phase 3 (Interviews 31-42)
- Players should identify both conspiracies
- Two killer groups should become clear
- Release Phase 3 case files (survey report, trust deed)

### Phase 4 (Interviews 43-50)
- **REQUEST-BASED** - players must ask for specific confrontations
- Check `01_complete_solution.md` for unlock requirements
- Don't give confessions to players who haven't done the work

## COMMON PLAYER MISTAKES

1. **Assuming one killer** - Remind through evidence that T1 feels different
2. **Ignoring T1** - The original twins are key to understanding the curse origin
3. **Missing the deed** - The trust deed is crucial for T1 motive
4. **Trusting Devrao** - He's innocent but players often suspect the family head
5. **Overlooking Vasundhara** - She appears briefly but is the T1 mastermind

## RED HERRINGS

| Suspect | Why They Seem Guilty | Actually Innocent Because |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Mahesh More | Angry, threatened brother's children | Has alibi, genuine grief |
| Gadkari Saheb | Had affair, obsessive behavior | Didn't know about murders, genuine grief |
| Devrao Gokhale | Kiln family head | Genuinely ignorant of brother's crimes |
| Ravindra | Threatened survey clerk | No connection to child deaths |
