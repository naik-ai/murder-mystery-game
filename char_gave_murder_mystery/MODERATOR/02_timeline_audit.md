## B. ALIBI ANALYSIS

### KILLER 1: Raghoba (T1 Executor)
**Timeline:** 1988 (15 years ago)
**Role:** Executor - drowned twins on Vasundhara's orders

| Alibi Element | Claimed | Reality | Verification Source | Exploitable Gap |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Evening whereabouts | Working at Wada | Took twins to lake | Haribhau observed him returning wet | YES - No alibi for dusk period |
| Payment next morning | Normal wages | Unusually large payment from Vasundhara | Kisan found old hidden currency | YES - Payment pattern suspicious |
| Post-murder behavior | Normal servant duties | Nightmares, calling out twins' names for 15 years | Kisan's observations | YES - Guilt behavior obvious |
| Ghost sighting panic | Genuine supernatural vision | Guilt-induced hallucination | 05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_1/03_constable_patil_report_t1.md (lines 52-53) | YES - Psychological breakdown |

**Alibi Gaps:**
- No witnesses to his movements during dusk period when twins were taken
- Return to Wada while wet was observed by Haribhau but not questioned
- Payment the next morning has no legitimate explanation

**Verification Sources:**
- Haribhau (cook) - observed wet clothes (03_MURDER_STRUCTURE/01_timeline_overview.md line 86)
- Kisan (servant) - noticed nightmares, found hidden money (03_MURDER_STRUCTURE/01_timeline_overview.md line 87)
- Kalyani's drawing to Sarla - identified him (05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_2/17_parubai_kadam.md lines 62-65)

---

### KILLER 2: Vasundhara (T1 Mastermind)
**Timeline:** 1988 (15 years ago)
**Role:** Mastermind - ordered murders, created curse legend

| Alibi Element | Claimed | Reality | Verification Source | Exploitable Gap |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Knowledge of deed | Unaware | Feared twins' claim to land | Deed rumor via Sarla | YES - Clear motive |
| Relationship to twins | Distant | Watched them and Kalyani for days | Sarla's testimony | YES - Surveillance pattern |
| Instructions to Raghoba | Never gave any | Explicit murder order with payment | Raghoba's confession | YES - Direct testimony |
| Curse narrative origin | Believed in it | Created and spread it via servants | 03_MURDER_STRUCTURE/01_timeline_overview.md (lines 70-74) | YES - She is source |

**Alibi Gaps:**
- Physical alibi not needed - she ordered, did not execute
- Connection to payment traceable through unusual withdrawal (08_APPENDIX/04_evidence_inventory.md line 34)
- Control over curse narrative proves knowledge

**Verification Sources:**
- Raghoba's confession (05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_4/47_dhondiba_confronted.md lines 61-90)
- Sarla's knowledge of surveillance (05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_2/17_parubai_kadam.md line 66)
- Talathi records show unusual financial activity

---

### KILLER 3: Madhav Gokhale (T2 and T3 Killer)
**Timeline:** 1995 (T2) and September 2002 (T3)
**Role:** Direct killer of four children

| Alibi Element | Claimed | Reality | Verification Source | Exploitable Gap |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Night of T3 (Sept 14) | At kiln, night shift with Prakash | At lake disposing waste, killed Gauri | Sunita's overheard conversation | YES - Accomplice is co-conspirator |
| Worker alibis | "Ten, fifteen workers will tell you same" | Workers depend on him for jobs - unreliable | 05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_2/19_bhau_patil.md (lines 70-71) | YES - Economic coercion |
| Lake visits | "No reason to go there" | Regular night trips for dumping, "once, twice a month" | Sunita's direct observation | YES - Pattern of access |
| Waste disposal | Goes to Rakhe (official site) | Actually dumps at lake illegally | Sunita, Dinesh observations | YES - Physical evidence |

**Alibi Gaps:**
- Alibi involves Prakash, who was his accomplice
- Workers are economically dependent, unreliable witnesses
- Multiple independent witnesses (Sunita, Dinesh) contradict his claims
- "Those children saw us" overheard directly

**Verification Sources:**
- Sunita Dhere's testimony (05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_3/39_saku_waghmare.md lines 66-79)
- Dinesh Pote's night sightings (03_MURDER_STRUCTURE/01_timeline_overview.md lines 203-205)
- Aarav's description matches adult male, kiln smell (05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_2/16_balu_mane.md lines 46-72)
- Physical evidence at lake (tire tracks, waste residue)

---

### ACCOMPLICE: Prakash Kore (T3 Accomplice)
**Timeline:** September 2002 (T3 only)
**Role:** Accomplice - helped Madhav, drove truck

| Alibi Element | Claimed | Reality | Verification Source | Exploitable Gap |
|---------------|---------|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| September 14 whereabouts | "Here. Working. Like always" | At lake with Madhav | His own confession Phase 4 | YES - Coordinated with Madhav |
| Night operations | "We don't deliver at night" | Regular night trips to lake | Sunita's observations | YES - Contradicts claim |
| Knowledge of curse | "Everyone believes. It's easier that way" | Knows curse is cover story | 05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_2/20_natha_shinde.md (line 67) | YES - Slip reveals knowledge |
| Wife's concerns | "She knows nothing" | Wife noticed disturbed behavior, late nights | 05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_2/20_natha_shinde.md (lines 73-78) | YES - Behavioral evidence |

**Alibi Gaps:**
- Physical description matches Aarav's "shorter figure"
- Wife's observations of disturbed behavior
- Statement "It's easier that way" implies knowledge of cover-up
- Confession obtained in Phase 4 (05_INTERVIEWS/PHASE_4/45_natha_shinde_confronted.md)

|----------|--------------|---------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| Trust deed (hidden) | Pre-1988 | Gadkari family | Phase 3 | Talathi records | YES |
| Raghav's survey report | ~1986 | Raghav Nimkar | Phase 3 | Harish Karande | YES |
| Hidden currency (Raghoba) | 1988 | Vasundhara | Phase 2 | Kisan | YES |

| Toxic waste residue | Ongoing | Kiln operations | Phase 3 | Leena (testing) | YES |
| Dr. Pande's notes | Pre-investigation | Dr. Pande | Phase 3 | Leena | YES |

### Evidence Revelation Sequence Analysis

| Phase | Evidence Available | Player Discovery Order | Logic Check |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | Police reports, medical records, curse testimonies | Start with official record, build doubt | LOGICAL |
| Phase 2 | Aarav's testimony, servant observations, payment patterns | Key witness + behavioral evidence | LOGICAL |
| Phase 3 | Raghav's report, Sunita's testimony, physical evidence at lake | Documentary proof + eyewitness | LOGICAL |
| Phase 4 | Confessions (Raghoba, Madhav, Prakash) | Confrontation after evidence assembled | LOGICAL |

### Evidence Chain Integrity

**Chain A: T2-T3 Murders (Madhav)**
```
Phase 2: Aarav's "two figures" + kiln smell
    |
Phase 2: Dinesh sees night activity (thinks ghosts)
    |
Phase 3: Sunita overhears "those children saw us"
    |
Phase 3: Physical evidence (tracks, waste)
    |
Phase 4: Prakash confession -> Madhav confession
```
**INTEGRITY CHECK:** SOUND - Each phase builds logically

**Chain B: T1 Murders (Vasundhara/Raghoba)**
```
Phase 1: Constable mentions Raghoba's "visions"
    |
Phase 2: Sarla reveals Kalyani's drawing (woman in white, bearded man)
    |
Phase 2: Kisan notices nightmares, hidden money
    |
Phase 2: Haribhau confirms wet clothes, payment
    |
Phase 3: Kalyani confirms affair, points to Wada
    |
Phase 4: Raghoba confession -> implicates Vasundhara
```
**INTEGRITY CHECK:** SOUND - Separate trail from T2-T3

---

## E. IMPOSSIBLE SEQUENCE CHECK

### Physical Movement Verification

| Character | Location A | Time A | Location B | Time B | Distance | Possible? |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Raghoba (T1) | Wada | Afternoon | Korde Tal | Dusk | ~30 min walk | YES |
| Raghoba (T1) | Korde Tal | After murders | Wada | Evening | ~30 min walk | YES |
| Madhav (T3) | Bhatti | Evening | Korde Tal | Night | ~20 min by truck | YES |
| Madhav (T3) | Korde Tal | After murder | Bhatti | Late night | ~20 min by truck | YES |
| Prakash (T3) | Bhatti | Evening | Korde Tal | Night | With Madhav | YES |
| Aarav (T3) | Korde Tal | Murder | Dhuke | Dawn | Running, hiding | YES - found at 6:47 AM |
| Gauri & Aarav (T3) | More house | Evening | Korde Tal | Night | ~15 min walk | YES |

### No Impossible Sequences Detected

All character movements are physically possible given:
- Village distances (30-60 minutes walking between areas per 01_WORLD_BUILDING/01_setting.md line 153)
- Truck access for kiln workers
- Children's ability to walk to lake

## F. WARNINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### WARNING LEVEL ISSUES

| ID | Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|----|-------|----------|----------------|
| W-001 | Gopal's death timing vague | LOW | Consider specifying "3 months after" vs "few months after" |
| W-002 | Exact times for T1 murder not specified | LOW | Acceptable for 15-year-old incident - memories fade |
| W-003 | Raghav Nimkar's death cause (snakebite) not investigated | INFO | Red herring correctly marked - no fix needed |

### STRENGTHS OF TIMELINE STRUCTURE

1. **Two separate conspiracies** are cleanly separated in time and evidence chains
2. **Verification requires multiple sources** - no single testimony proves anything
3. **Alibi weaknesses** are realistic and exploitable
4. **Evidence discovery order** is logical and builds tension
5. **Ghost ambiguity** maintained through Phase 3 as designed

### AUDIT CONCLUSION

The timeline structure is **internally consistent** with no impossible sequences detected. The three murder timelines (T1: 1988, T2: 1995, T3: 2002) maintain proper chronological integrity. Character alibis have realistic gaps that can be exploited through investigation. Evidence revelation follows a logical progression that supports the game's four-phase structure.

**Final Score: 88/100**
- Timeline Consistency: 95/100
- Alibi Plausibility: 90/100
- Evidence Chain Logic: 90/100
- Contradiction Handling: 85/100 (intentional lies vs errors clearly distinguished)
- Movement Feasibility: 100/100
