# CHARACTER VOICE GUIDELINES
## चार गावे - Distinct Speech Patterns

---

## OVERVIEW

This document establishes distinct voice patterns for the cast to address the audit finding: "Many voices share the same cadence; distinct speech patterns by class, age, or role would help characterization."

The goal is authentic differentiation without caricature - voices should feel real to rural Maharashtra circa 2002-2003.

---

## PART A: VOICE CATEGORIES

### 1. UPPER CASTE AUTHORITY (Formal Power)

**Characters:** Gadkari Saheb, Vasundhara, Devrao Gokhale, Sarpanch Vilas Patre

**Linguistic Features:**
- **Sentence Structure:** Complete, grammatically correct sentences. Longer constructions with subordinate clauses. Never fragments.
- **Vocabulary:** Sanskrit-derived words (dharma, kartavya, maryada). Formal pronouns (aap, tumhi vs tu). Administrative language when convenient.
- **Formality Level:** High even in private moments. Maintains distance through language.
- **Power Markers:** Speaks in declaratives, not questions. Uses "I will explain" not "Let me try to explain." Commands disguised as observations.

**Marathi/Hindi Markers:**
- "Samajhiye" (understand - imperative polite)
- "Yeh toh aapko pata hai" (you already know this)
- "Hamare yahan aisa nahi hota" (such things don't happen here)
- "Parivaarik maamla hai" (it's a family matter)

**Discomfort/Deflection Patterns:**
- Shifts to third person or passive voice when uncomfortable
- Uses tradition/custom as shield: "Hamara riwaz hai..."
- Sudden formality increase signals hiding something
- Stands up or moves to end uncomfortable topics
- Offers chai/hospitality to change subject

**Sample Cadence:**
```
"You are asking about matters that are not... let me say this differently.
The family has always maintained certain standards. What happens within
these walls is not for outside discussion. You understand, of course.
As a fellow educated person."
```

### 2. MIDDLE CLASS EDUCATED (Professional Vernacular)

**Characters:** Teacher Shaila Jore, Postmaster Ramesh Bhat, Talathi Anand Sathe, Constable Mohan Ghadge, Havaldar Pradeep Phadke

**Linguistic Features:**
- **Sentence Structure:** Mix of formal and colloquial. Complete sentences in professional mode, more relaxed in personal asides.
- **Vocabulary:** Uses English technical terms naturally (report, file, evidence, pattern). Government vocabulary. Educational references.
- **Formality Level:** Shifts based on audience - formal with superiors, warmer with villagers.
- **Professional Markers:** Cites rules, procedures, "as per guidelines," "officially speaking."

**Register Shifts:**
- Professional mode: "The report indicates..." / "As per records..."
- Personal mode: "Dekho, main kya kahoon..." (Look, what can I say...)
- Confidential mode: Drops to whisper, uses "off the record"

**Marathi/Hindi Markers:**
- "File mein likha hai" (it's written in the file)
- "Mera kaam hai, main karta hoon" (I do my job)
- "Personally speaking..."

**Discomfort/Deflection Patterns:**
- Retreats to official language when pressed
- "I am not authorized to..." / "That's above my pay grade"
- Papers shuffling, looking for documents
- Uses passive constructions: "It was decided" not "I decided"

**Sample Cadence:**
```
"The file says drowning. Officially, that is what happened. But
personally speaking... forty years I have sat in this office.
I see patterns. I say nothing. Pension is coming soon. You
understand what I am saying."
```

---

### 3. WORKING CLASS DIRECT (Labor Speech)

**Characters:** Prakash Kore, Dinesh Pote, Rukmini Lokhande, Sunita Dhere, Nilesh Raut, Kiln Workers

**Linguistic Features:**

**Physical Metaphors:**

**Marathi/Hindi Markers:**
- "Kaam hai" (there's work)

**Discomfort/Deflection Patterns:**
- Returns to physical activity (continues working while talking)

- "I was working" as universal alibi
- Sudden exhaustion: "Long day. Tired."

**Sample Cadence:**
```
"Truck goes. Night time. Where? Not my business. I load bricks.
Get paid. Go home. What Madhav-saheb does after dark - I don't
ask. Questions don't feed children."
```

**Sample Cadence (Madhav - early interviews):**
```
"The lake? At night? (laughs) Why would I go there? Ash disposal
is at Rakhe site. East of here. Government approved. Everything
documented. My brother handles the paperwork - ask him. You can
see the permits. We are legitimate business. Sixty families depend
on us. (pause) What exactly are you asking?"
```

**Sample Cadence (Raghoba - before confession):**
```
"That night, saheb? Which night? (pause) Oh. The twins. I was
in Wada. Where else would I be? I am old man. Night comes, I
sleep. (quickly) Haribhau saw me. In my room. We talked. No,
wait - maybe we didn't talk that night. But he saw me. He will
tell you."
```

**Sensory/Supernatural Vocabulary:**
- Smell of death vs smell of killing (different)
- Eyes forced closed (murder detail)
- Spirits don't drive trucks
- Ghosts don't wear gamchas

**Sample Cadence (Gajanan Buwa):**
```
"You want names? Names are cages. The truth is bigger than names.
But since you ask - look to where fire burns without light. Look
to where water holds secrets. Look to where the great house hides
shame behind charity. (smiles) See? You don't need old Gajanan.
You already know. You are afraid to know that you know."
```

**Sample Cadence (Rangubai):**
```
"(exhales bidi smoke) I know death. I know what water does to
body. I know what time does. (pause) I know what is wrong.
(leans forward) Ghosts don't leave kiln smell. Ghosts don't
force eyes closed. Seventy-five years I have lived by saying
nothing. But you are Sarla's daughter. Maybe... maybe it is
time for truth."

## PART C: REVISION CHECKLIST

### Interviews Flagged for Voice Revision

The following interviews show characters speaking too similarly and need revision based on these guidelines:

---

#### 1. INTERVIEW #04 - Sarpanch vs INTERVIEW #18 - Devrao Gokhale

**Issue:** Both use same formal deflection patterns. Nearly identical sentence rhythms.

**SARPANCH (Current):**
> "Pattern? (laughs dismissively) Pune people see patterns everywhere. This is village, officer. Things happen differently here."

**DEVRAO (Current):**
> "Ash? We have a designated area. Rakhe site. East of here. Government approved. We follow all rules."

**Both:** Complete sentences, similar rhythm, defensive but smooth.

**REVISION - SARPANCH (Add political condescension):**
> "Pattern? (laughs, sits back) Officer saheb, with respect - you are from Pune, yes? University education, city posting. You see patterns. Here? We see what the lake shows us. What ancestors have shown us. Sixty generations of pattern is called tradition. (spreads hands) I cannot explain this to someone who thinks in your way. It is not insult. Simply... different worlds."

**REVISION - DEVRAO (Add businessman defensiveness):**
> "(frowns) Ash? What about ash? We have designated site. Government papers. Everything documented. My brother Madhav handles- (stops) Why this question? Who has said something? These rumors are bad for business. Sixty families depend on this kiln. We cannot have CID asking about ash when we have permits. (stands) I will show you permits. Right now."

---

#### 2. INTERVIEW #08 - Mahesh More vs INTERVIEW #06 - Raghunath More

**Issue:** Brothers both express grief in similar flowing sentences despite different characters (one angry, one broken).

**MAHESH (Current):**
> "Brother. Yes. We share blood. That is all we share."

**RAGHUNATH (Current):**
> "Ask. Nothing matters now."

**Both:** Short sentence, similar resignation.

**REVISION - MAHESH (Add anger, physicality):**
> "(spits on ground) Brother? (kicks at soil) Blood. We share blood. He got the good land - water, fertility. I got this. Rocks and clay. (gestures at barren field) So yes. Brother. The word means nothing. (returns to hoeing) You want to know if I killed his children for land? Ask. Ask directly. I'm not afraid of questions."

**REVISION - RAGHUNATH (Add hollowness, physical stillness):**
> "(staring at floor, motionless) ...Ask. (long silence) (doesn't look up) (even longer silence) Nothing matters. Ask what you want. (voice flat, dead)"

---

#### 3. INTERVIEW #11 - Rangubai vs INTERVIEW #13 - Gajanan Buwa

**Issue:** Both elder wisdom figures sound too similar - mystical, flowing, rhythmic.

**RANGUBAI (Current):**
> "I know death. I know what water does to body. I know what time does. I know what is wrong."

**GAJANAN BUWA (Current):**
> "The one who asks also knows. The one who knows is afraid to say. Why ask an old fool when the truth walks among you?"

**Both:** Parallel structure, rhythmic, wisdom-speaker cadence.

**REVISION - RANGUBAI (Add practical death-worker knowledge, physical description):**
> "(stubs out bidi, examines her own hands) These hands. Sixty years of washing bodies. (turns palms up) I know what death does. Water death - specific marks. Time death - different marks. Violence? (touches own throat) ...here. Different again. (looks up sharply) You want wisdom? Go to temple. You want to know what those bodies showed me? Sit. Listen. No riddles."

**REVISION - GAJANAN BUWA (Add performative madness, Sanskrit fragments):**
> "(chuckles, ash falling from matted hair) Kon poochta hai? Who asks? (switches to Sanskrit-inflected Hindi) Jo jaanta hai, woh poochta nahi. Jo poochta hai... (laughs wildly, then sudden clarity) ...woh jaanta hai lekin darta hai. (grabs Leena's wrist, whispers) Satya tumhare beech chalta hai. Walking. Among you. (releases, returns to mad voice) But old Gajanan is fool. What does fool know? Ask the lake. Ask the fire. Ask the silent mother."

---

#### 4. INTERVIEW #16 - Aarav vs INTERVIEW #21 - Nilesh Raut

**Issue:** Child trauma and adult anxiety both rendered with similar incomplete sentence patterns.

**AARAV (Current):**
> "They came. Two... not girls. Big. Like... taller than Baba."

**NILESH (Current):**
> "My father? He's dead. Three years now. What about him?"

**REVISION - AARAV (Add child vocabulary, sensory overwhelm):**
> "(whispers) They came. (pause) Two. Not girls. (holds up two fingers) Big big. (gestures WAY above own head) Like... like... (struggles for comparison) bigger than Baba. Bigger than house. (suddenly) BAD SMELL. Like bhatti. Gauri said- Gauri said 'Aarav, it smells like-' (stops, hands shake)"

**REVISION - NILESH (Add adult anxiety, complete-but-nervous sentences):**
> "(startles visibly) My father? Why-why are you asking about my father? He died. Three years. Cancer. He's dead. (realizes he's repeating) What is this about? (stands up too fast) I'm just running the kiln. Small operation. I don't- I don't know what you're- (sits back down) What about my father?"

---

#### 5. INTERVIEW #22 - Postmaster vs INTERVIEW #12 - Teacher

**Issue:** Both middle-class educated characters have identical pattern of formal-to-confidential shift.

**POSTMASTER (Current):**
> "Money orders are private matters. I cannot share details without proper authorization."

**TEACHER (Current):**
> "You mentioned to the constable that the Karande children were asking questions before they died."
> "I may have said that. Yes."

**REVISION - POSTMASTER (Add bureaucratic precision, ledger-speak):**
> "(adjusts spectacles, doesn't look up from ledger) Money orders. Yes. Private. Sender, receiver, amount, date. All recorded. All confidential. Section 4, clause 7, Postal Service Act. (finally looks up) You have warrant? Authorization letter? (pause) No? Then what I can tell you is limited. Officially."

**REVISION - TEACHER (Add educator's hedging, chalk-dust pauses):**
> "(removes spectacles, breathes on them, cleans slowly) That matter. Yes. I may have... mentioned something. To the constable. At the time. (puts spectacles back) The children were curious. As children are. Questions about... various things. (carefully) Whether I recall specifics - after eight years - that is different question."

---

#### 6. INTERVIEW #39 - Sunita vs INTERVIEW #17 - Sarla

**Issue:** Both Vasti women sound identical when revealing secrets.

**SUNITA (Current):**
> "You promise? On your mother's head?"

**SARLA (Current):**
> "If I tell you, it stays with us."

**Both:** Direct, conditional revelation pattern.

**REVISION - SUNITA (Add poverty fear, self-abasement):**
> "(grabs Leena's hands, desperate) You promise? On your mother's head? On your father's spirit? I am poor woman. If Madhav-saheb knows I talked... (releases hands, whispers) my children will starve. Who will hire woman who talks? Promise. Promise me first. Then I tell."

**REVISION - SARLA (Add maternal authority, kitchen confidence):**
> "(continues chopping vegetables, doesn't look up) What I tell you stays here. (chops harder) This is not request. (finally looks at daughter) I know you are doctor now. CID people. Important. But you are still my daughter. What I say does not go in any report. (waits for nod) Good. (resumes chopping) Now. The boy."
