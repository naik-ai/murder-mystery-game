## FAILURE STATES (For Design Reference)

**Players Cannot Fail** (one true ending), but they can get stuck:

### Common Stuck Points:
1. **Assuming one killer** - Won't find connection between T1 and T2-T3 evidence
2. **Trusting authority** - Constable's reports are wrong
3. **Dismissing Aarav** - His testimony is key, even if "crazy"
4. **Missing payment pattern** - Connects Raut guilt money to larger story
5. **Not interviewing servants** - Haribhau/Kisan have crucial observations

### Hints System (if implemented):
- After X time stuck, Leena/Arjun can "suggest" a direction
- "Maybe we should talk to the servants at Wada"
- "Aarav's description doesn't match young girls"
- "These payment records seem odd"
