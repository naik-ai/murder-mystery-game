**A Cooperative Murder Mystery for 5 Detectives**

---

## Overview

When billionaire industrialist Arjun Malhotra is found strangled in his private study after a lavish party, five detectives must work together to unravel a complex web of betrayal, greed, and revenge.

This is a **cooperative** murder mystery — players work as a team, not against each other. Each detective receives different evidence based on their specialty. No single player has enough information to solve the case alone.
