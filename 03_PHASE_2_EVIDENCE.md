| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|

| Date | December 15, 2024 |
| Interviewed by | Inspector Mehra |

I was asked to recall any other observations from the party.

I remember one more thing. Around 11:45 or maybe midnight, I saw the two young ladies talking near the terrace stairs. The one who is engaged to Mr. Malhotra and the assistant.

It did not look friendly. The fiancée was pointing her finger. The assistant was shaking her head. She looked scared maybe. Then the assistant walked away quickly toward the garden.

I heard the fiancée say something. It sounded like "stay away from him" or "I know what you're doing." Something like that. I was not close enough to hear exactly.

Later I saw the fiancée go to the bar cart. She was there for a few minutes, looking at the glasses. I thought she was looking for her drink.

That is all I remember.
