| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Witness | Suresh Patil, Bartender |
| Date | December 15, 2024 |
| Statement Taken By | SI Pradeep Sawant |

**Statement (Additional):**

"After my first statement, I remembered something else.

Around 11:45 PM, I saw Kavya Madam and Deepika Madam arguing on the terrace. Kavya Madam was very upset. I heard her say something like 'stay away from him' and 'I know what you're doing.'

Deepika Madam looked scared. She walked away quickly.

Also, I saw Rohit Sir go toward the study around 1:50 AM. He was there for about 20 minutes before he came out and left. He seemed calm when he came out — which I thought was strange given how upset he'd been earlier in the evening."
