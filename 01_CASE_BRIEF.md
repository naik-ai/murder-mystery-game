## ABOUT THE CAUSE OF DEATH

### Ligature Strangulation

Ligature strangulation involves compression of the neck using a flexible object (cord, rope, belt, etc.) applied with sufficient force to occlude blood vessels and/or airway.

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Ligature marks | Indicates external force applied to neck |
| Petechial hemorrhaging | Small red dots in eyes/face from blood pressure |
| Hyoid bone | May be fractured in violent strangulation |
| Defensive wounds | Typically present when victim can resist |

> **Critical Observation:** The victim showed **NO DEFENSIVE WOUNDS** despite violent death. This suggests he was unable to resist the attack.
