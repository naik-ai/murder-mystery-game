## PHASE 3: THE TWIST

**Duration: 15 Minutes**

This evidence is shared with ALL detectives.

**Host:** Read the REVELATION aloud before distributing documents.

---

## HOST READS ALOUD:

> "Detectives, we've received urgent new information from the forensics laboratory. This significantly changes our understanding of the case."

---

## THE KEY REVELATION

**THE SEDATIVE WAS IN THE WHISKEY BOTTLE.**

The victim was drugged BEFORE he was strangled. He couldn't fight back because he was already incapacitated by a massive dose of Diazepam.

This explains the critical autopsy finding: **NO DEFENSIVE WOUNDS despite violent death by strangulation.**

## SUPPLEMENTARY FORENSIC REPORT

**MAHARASHTRA STATE FORENSIC SCIENCE LABORATORY**
**SUPPLEMENTARY TOXICOLOGY REPORT**

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Case Number | MH/ALB/2024/1847 |
| Date | December 16, 2024 |
| Classification | URGENT — REVISED FINDINGS |

---

### SUBJECT

Re-examination of Evidence Item EV-003 (Macallan 25 Year Whiskey Bottle)

---

### ORIGINAL FINDING (December 14, 2024)

"No contamination detected"

---

### REVISED FINDING (December 16, 2024)

Upon enhanced spectrometric analysis of bottle residue:

**DIAZEPAM DETECTED**

| Measurement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Concentration in bottle residue | 425 ng/mL |
| Note | Concentrated in remaining liquid at bottom of bottle |

---

### INTERPRETATION

The presence of Diazepam in the bottle residue indicates that the sedative was added to the **BOTTLE**, not to an individual glass.

| Measurement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Bottle volume at examination | Approximately 200ml remaining |
| Original bottle volume | 700ml |
| Victim's blood Diazepam level | 850 ng/mL (well above toxic threshold) |

This indicates approximately 500ml had been consumed prior to examination. At the victim's blood concentration, he would have experienced:

- Severe drowsiness
- Profound muscle weakness
- Impaired coordination
- Confusion

**He would have been physically incapable of resisting a physical attack.**

---

### TOXICOLOGICAL TIMELINE

| Time After Ingestion | Expected Effect |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| 15-30 minutes | Onset of drowsiness, relaxation |
| 30-45 minutes | Significant sedation, muscle weakness begins |
| 45-60 minutes | **Profound incapacitation at this dosage** |

If the victim consumed whiskey at approximately 1:30 AM, he would have been significantly impaired by 2:00 AM — **the estimated time of strangulation**.

---

### CRITICAL CONNECTION

**Why couldn't the victim fight back?**

The strangulation marks show the victim was attacked from behind with a silk cord. Normally, a healthy adult would:
- Struggle violently
- Attempt to pull the ligature away
- Claw at attacker's hands
- Kick, thrash, or attempt escape

The victim did **NONE** of these things. The sedative explains why.

---

### GLASS VS. BOTTLE DETECTION

**Question:** Why was Diazepam not detected in the whiskey glass (EV-001)?

**Answer:** The glass had dried by the time of examination. Dried residue contains trace amounts below the standard detection limit (50 ng/mL). The bottle retained liquid, allowing accurate measurement.

| Regarding | Whiskey bottle delivery |

I received a delivery on December 12 around 3:45 in the afternoon. It was a gift box with an expensive whiskey bottle inside. The gift card said it was from Mr. Saxena.

I placed the bottle in Sir's whiskey cabinet in the study. The bottle was sealed. I remember this because Sir is very particular about his whiskey. He always checks the seal before opening any bottle. He says you cannot trust anyone these days.

Sir was in Mumbai that day. He returned on December 13 evening.

I did not open the bottle. I did not touch it again after placing it in the cabinet.

**SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT**

| Name | Vikram Saxena |

| Regarding | Gift bottle |

---

Yes, I sent the Macallan to Arjun. It was a peace offering.

We have been negotiating a merger for months. The terms changed recently and I was not happy about it. But I still wanted to find a solution. Arjun and I have known each other for 20 years.

I ordered the bottle through my usual supplier. I did not tamper with it. I did not even see the bottle — it was shipped directly from the supplier to his estate.

I was at the party on December 13. Arjun and I did not get a chance to open the bottle together. We had an argument at the gala about the merger terms. I left the after-party early because I was upset.

I did not go to his study. I did not see him after approximately midnight when we argued on the terrace.

My phone records and ferry tickets confirm I was in Mumbai by 1:30 AM. I could not have been at the estate when he died.

I did not kill Arjun. Someone is trying to frame me by using my gift.

## THE TWO-STAGE MURDER

**SUMMARY FOR DETECTIVES**

This was not a simple killing. It was a **planned, two-stage murder**:

| Stage | Method | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Stage 1** | Diazepam in whiskey bottle | Incapacitate the victim |
| **Stage 2** | Ligature strangulation | Kill the helpless victim |

**Key Questions:**
1. Who had access to drug the bottle? (December 12, after delivery)
2. Who had the physical opportunity to strangle the victim? (After 1:30 AM on December 14)
3. Who had both motive AND opportunity for both stages?
