## SUPPLEMENTARY FORENSIC REPORT

**MAHARASHTRA STATE FORENSIC SCIENCE LABORATORY**
**SUPPLEMENTARY TOXICOLOGY REPORT**

| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Case Number | MH/ALB/2024/1847 |
| Date | December 16, 2024 |
| Classification | URGENT — REVISED FINDINGS |

---

### SUBJECT

Re-examination of Evidence Item EV-003 (Macallan 25 Year Whiskey Bottle)

---

### ORIGINAL FINDING (December 14, 2024)

"No contamination detected"

---

### REVISED FINDING (December 16, 2024)

Upon enhanced spectrometric analysis of bottle residue:

**TRACE ACONITINE DETECTED**

| Measurement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Concentration in bottle residue | 0.8 ng/mL |
| Note | Lower than glass concentration due to dilution effect |

---

### INTERPRETATION

The presence of Aconitine in the bottle residue indicates that the poison was added to the **BOTTLE**, not to an individual glass.

The lower concentration in the bottle compared to the glass (EV-001) is consistent with the poison settling toward the bottom of the liquid over time.

| Measurement | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Bottle volume at examination | Approximately 200ml remaining |
| Original bottle volume | 700ml |

This indicates approximately 500ml had been consumed prior to examination. Multiple drinks were poured from this bottle.

---

### TOXICOLOGICAL NOTE

Aconitine has higher density than ethanol. In a standing liquid, the compound will gradually settle toward the bottom.

- Initial pours from a contaminated bottle would contain **lower concentration**
- Later pours — from the bottom portion — would contain **significantly higher concentration**

This explains how multiple persons could drink from the same bottle with varying effects.

---

### ADDITIONAL FINDING: BOTTLE SEAL

Re-examination of bottle seal remnants (recovered from wastebasket):

The seal shows evidence of **careful removal and reattachment**. Heat marks consistent with re-sealing technique observed.

**Conclusion:** The bottle was opened, tampered with, and resealed prior to the visible opening on the night of December 13-14.

I received a delivery on December 12 around 3:45 in the afternoon. It was a gift box with an expensive whiskey bottle inside. The gift card said it was from Mr. Saxena.

I placed the bottle in Sir's whiskey cabinet in the study. The bottle was sealed. I remember this because Sir is very particular about his whiskey. He always checks the seal before opening any bottle. He says you cannot trust anyone these days.

Sir was in Mumbai that day. He returned on December 13 evening.

I did not open the bottle. I did not touch it again after placing it in the cabinet.

## VIKRAM SAXENA — SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT

**SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT**

| Name | Vikram Saxena |
| Date | December 16, 2024 |
| Regarding | Gift bottle |

Yes, I sent the Macallan to Arjun. It was a peace offering.

We have been negotiating a merger for months. The terms changed recently and I was not happy about it. But I still wanted to find a solution. Arjun and I have known each other for 20 years.

I ordered the bottle through my usual supplier. I did not tamper with it. I did not even see the bottle — it was shipped directly from the supplier to his estate.

I was at the party on December 13. Arjun and I did not get a chance to open the bottle together. We had an argument at the gala about the merger terms. I left the after-party early because I was upset.

I did not go to his study. I did not see him after approximately midnight when we argued on the terrace.

My phone records and ferry tickets confirm I was in Mumbai by 1:30 AM. I could not have been at the estate when he died.

I did not kill Arjun. Someone is trying to frame me.

*Statement read and confirmed.*
