# PHASE 3: THE TWIST

## The Last Toast — Cooperative Murder Mystery

> **📋 DISTRIBUTE TO: ALL PLAYERS TOGETHER**

> This is the major reveal. Host reads the revelation aloud, then ALL detectives
> review this evidence together as a group.

---

## PHASE 3: THE TWIST

**Duration: 15 Minutes**

This evidence is shared with ALL detectives.

**Host:** Read the REVELATION aloud before distributing documents.

---

## HOST READS ALOUD:

> "Detectives, we've received urgent new information from the forensics laboratory. This significantly changes our understanding of the case."

---

## THE KEY REVELATION

**THE BOTTLE WAS SWAPPED.**

The bottle in evidence (**BTL-7711**) is NOT the same bottle that was delivered as a gift (**BTL-7794**).

Someone replaced the original gift bottle with a pre-drugged duplicate.

This explains both:

- The sedative in the whiskey
- Why the killer chose this elaborate method — they had advance knowledge of the gift delivery

**The critical mystery remains:** No defensive wounds despite violent death by strangulation. The victim was drugged BEFORE he was strangled. He couldn't fight back because he was already incapacitated.

## SUPPLEMENTARY FORENSIC REPORT

**MAHARASHTRA STATE FORENSIC SCIENCE LABORATORY**
**SUPPLEMENTARY TOXICOLOGY REPORT**

| Field          | Detail                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Case Number    | MH/ALB/2024/1847          |
| Date           | December 16, 2024         |
| Classification | URGENT — REVISED FINDINGS |

---

### SUBJECT

Re-examination of Evidence Item EV-003 (Bottle BTL-7711)

---

### FINDING

Upon enhanced spectrometric analysis of bottle residue:

**DIAZEPAM DETECTED**

| Measurement                     | Value                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Concentration in bottle residue | 425 ng/mL                                            |
| Note                            | Concentrated in remaining liquid at bottom of bottle |

---

### INTERPRETATION

The presence of Diazepam in the bottle residue confirms that the sedative was added to the **BOTTLE** before the party.

| Measurement                   | Value                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Bottle volume at examination  | Approximately 200ml remaining          |
| Original bottle volume        | 700ml                                  |
| Victim's blood Diazepam level | 850 ng/mL (well above toxic threshold) |

At the victim's blood concentration, he would have experienced:

- Severe drowsiness
- Profound muscle weakness
- Impaired coordination
- Confusion

**He would have been physically incapable of resisting a physical attack.**

---

### TOXICOLOGICAL TIMELINE

| Time After Ingestion | Expected Effect                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 15-30 minutes        | Onset of drowsiness, relaxation              |
| 30-45 minutes        | Significant sedation, muscle weakness begins |
| 45-60 minutes        | **Profound incapacitation at this dosage**   |

If the victim consumed whiskey at approximately 1:35 AM, he would have been significantly impaired by 2:00 AM — **the estimated time of strangulation**.

## VIKRAM SAXENA — SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT

**SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT**

| Field     | Detail            |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Name      | Vikram Saxena     |
| Date      | December 16, 2024 |
| Regarding | Gift bottle       |

---

Yes, I sent the Macallan to Arjun. It was a peace offering.

We have been negotiating a merger for months. The terms changed recently and I was not happy about it. But I still wanted to find a solution. Arjun and I have known each other for 20 years.

I ordered the bottle through my usual supplier. **I did not tamper with it.** The bottle was shipped directly from the supplier to his estate. I never even saw it.

I was at the party on December 13. Arjun and I did not get a chance to open the bottle together. We had an argument about the merger terms around midnight. I left the party early because I was upset.

I did not go to his study. I did not see him after approximately midnight.

**My ferry ticket confirms I was in Mumbai by 1:30 AM.** I could not have been at the estate when he died.

Someone is trying to frame me by using my gift.

## THE TWO-STAGE MURDER

**SUMMARY FOR DETECTIVES**

This was not a simple killing. It was a **planned, two-stage murder**:

| Stage       | Method                              | Who Could Execute                           | When                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Stage 1** | Bottle SWAP (pre-drugged duplicate) | Person with cabinet access + drugged bottle | Dec 13, 19:00-20:00     |
| **Stage 2** | Ligature strangulation              | Person present after 2:00 AM                | Dec 14, ~02:15-02:30 AM |

---

### KEY QUESTIONS

1. **Who swapped the bottle?** (Access during Dec 13 staging window)
2. **Who purchased the drugged bottle?** (BTL-7711 on Dec 11)
3. **Who strangled the incapacitated victim?** (Present after 2:10 AM)
4. **What is the connection between the person who swapped and the person who strangled?**

---

### CRITICAL INSIGHT

**Rohit Malhotra's December 12 visit is now LESS relevant.**

When Rohit visited on December 12 (19:32-21:15), the **ORIGINAL bottle (BTL-7794)** was still in the cabinet. The swap happened on December 13, after he left.

The swap window (Dec 13, 19:00-20:00) points to:

- Kavya Sharma (signed staging checklist)
- Catering staff with study access
